Company Profiles
=============================================================
As part of your [market research assignment](assignment2.html), you will give a short 5 to 10 minute presentation on your company.  Your presentation should answer the following questions:

- What incentives does the company offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?
