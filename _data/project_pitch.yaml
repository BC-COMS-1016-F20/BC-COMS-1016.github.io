  name_of_your_project: Füd-Füd
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Our website will crowdsource food delivery.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem of a demand for food delivery from restaurants that do not offer a delivery option.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Instacart is the closest thing.  They are still different, however.  Instacart hires employees and handles delivery of groceries, alcohol, and other bulk purchase items, but crucially not already made food.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: It will likely be college students look for food, money, or both.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Those who deliver food will get the bonus of working whenever they want to, delivering joy to those in their community, and of course the delivery fee.  Those who order food will get their food delivered to their door, at the time they want it, and for an agreed upon delivery fee.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: Some will provide the delivery service, needing only the skill of buying food and walking to an address.  Others will provide the demand for food, and they need nothing but an appetite and laziness.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Quality will be ensured by ratings that delivery users will rate customers on a few metrics, and customers will rate aspects of the delivery process.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Results from the crowd will be used to filter feeds for both the delivery user, and customers so that poorly rated users won't be matched again.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: To begin with, users can either post requests for food deliveries, or post opportunities for others to get food delivered.  If there is a match between users looking for food, and users going to get food soon, then they will be automatically asked to settle on a delivery fee.  Once this is set, delivery users will go buy the food and deliver it to the customer who will pay the delivery person on venmo.  Then, the customers will be asked to rate the delivery person on quality, speed, price, and kindness.  The delivery user will then be asked to rank the customer on clarity of request, fairness of the pay, and kindness.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: Our project is successful if users from both sides of the service can sign up, log in, post requests and opportunities, fulfill requests, deliver, accept delivery fees, and rate their experience.  This will determine a successful project, but a successful business would need to create a platform with steady demand and supply.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Not finding enough users to build demand or supply.  Having difficulty implementing all of the above features in time for the project's completion.  Communicating the benefits to both types of users.  Figuring out the payment flow might also prove difficult.  Ensuring quality will also be hard to do.

  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Upvotes and downvotes will be secretly aggregated to determine order of images in the search. <p>You can search for Philadelphia, and get specific images, or PA and get images from all over PA including the Philly images sorted by votes.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Step 1&#58; Photographers upload images and tag the location.<p>Step 2&#58; Users search for locations and view images (also vote and possibly purchase prints)<p>Step 3&#58; Our algorithm sorts images in a location by clout. <p>Step 4&#58; Machine learning algorithm recommends new locations based on user votes. 
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The project is successful if there is a good volume of contributors, locations have many high resolution images, and there is high upvote activity and usage per user.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Potential problems are in starting off. There will initially be only few tagged places to search from. If the photographer increase quickly, the viewership can increase fairly quickly too.

  name_of_your_project: Food Trafficking
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: A platform that publishes crowdsourced data about the traffic of restaurants/cafes/food trucks around Penn’s campus
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Students will no longer have to wait in extremely long lines at food trucks or experience long wait times at their favorite restaurants or be disappointed as they show up to a very crowded cafe. Food trafficking will help solve this as you will be able to see realtime updates about how crowded a certain is at all times.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Yelp
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A tool for crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Hungry students and food fanatics
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: It will be similar to Yelp's incentive program. People will enjoy helping each other as they want to be able to use this platform when they need it. We will also have a similar elite status for people that have contributed a lot to the platform.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide a realtime ranking of how crowded a place is currently. It does not require other skills other than the ability to be able to access the platform.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The crowd will be Penn students and we will use email/facebook profile confirmation for quality assurance. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: It will be aggregated on a web/mobile platform and updated each time a contributor contributes.

The platform will average out all contributors's rankings within the past 15 minutes to get the most accurate results. 
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: It can be evaluated by the number of people that are signed up to use it and the number of people that are contributors. It will also be evaluated by the accurately of the platform.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: A problem might occur if there aren't enough contributors. Another problem can occur if too many people are using the platform. We need to be able to scale the application.

  name_of_your_project: Critic Critic
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: It will compare media representation based on political party, age, gender, or race.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: There are inconsistencies in how people of different walks of life are described for the same actions or beliefs. However, when these inconsistencies are addressed, it is written off as a small-scale problem with one news network or anchor. Compiling a large volume of data about these representations could help to address media bias and unfair representation. <p>For an explicit example&#58;<p>http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/09yfp5/the-broads-must-be-crazy---belittled-women
  what_similar_projects_exist: Miss Representation is a documentary that discusses how men and women are portrayed differently in politics, but it draws on a lot of anecdotal evidence, and does not discuss political parties, age, or race. 
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, Social science experiment with the crowd
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Crowdflower Workers
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: We will pay them money. 
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide an assessment of the demographic background and the name of the subject of an article. They need to be able to read in English, as we will be focusing on American media. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will create a volume of test data to quiz them, and then cross-check their answers with known data about popular politicians. If they identify Barack Obama as a young white female, we can discard their responses. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will use their identifications of, for example, black politicians, to run our feature-maker and gather our most commonly used descriptors. If there is conflict over the subject (i.e., multiple politicians referenced equally), we will not use that article in our responses. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Step one&#58; crawl the web (can we borrow your web crawler?) for articles about politicians. <p>Step two&#58; ask crowdflower workers to identify the demographics of the subject of each article. <p>Step three&#58; sort (via the spreadsheet produced by crowdflower) the articles into demographic groups (male vs. female, black vs. white vs. Hispanic)<p>Step four&#58; run our script to extract features on each separate set<p>Step five&#58; look at the results
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If we have comprehensible keywords for each group that are useful for analysis (not stopwords), we will consider it a success. <p>If our data indicates that the same words are used along party lines, or across gender lines, we'll consider that a success for humanity and chalk media bias up to isolated incidences. 
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Articles that mention multiple politicians will confuse the crowd. The crowd may be unable to identify a subject's political party by the context of an article if the source assumes familiarity with this information. Focusing on American politics will probably limit crowd familiarity, and may limit effectiveness of the crowd if they are rushing through the articles.

  name_of_your_project: PennRepairs
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: 	A crowdsourced way to report broken lights, heaters, and other important objects around Penn facilities. 
  what_problem_does_it_solve: 	As an institution that charges a high rate of tuition, it would be embarrassing for prospective students to walk around campus and see broken items and embellishments, especially inside major buildings. For current administrators and students, the process to file a service request is often obtuse and varies from building to building. This would offer a centralized service that anyone with a camera phone can use. <p>
  what_similar_projects_exist: iFixIt (www.ifixit.com) is a crowdsourced repair manual that covers many common items such as phones, televisions, bicycles, etc. This is more focused on self-repair than the reporting of public repairs. WhoCanFixMyCar.com is a service that matches people with broken cars to people who can service their car for their specific problem. Commercial enterprises like Amazon have services where a customer can take a picture of an item if it is broken and send it into customer service.<p>
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn students + Crowdflower workers
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Hopefully, the civic duty that Penn students feel towards maintaining the campus, in addition to the desire to not send formal requests to faculty services, will encourage them to send in pictures. If we do not get adequate participation, we can always pivot to scraping images from the web with the necessary location metadata. Obviously, this project works best if we get ~200-300 images of things that people think is broken. To expand our field, we can also include broken signs, labels, and other “minor” issues. <p>	Crowdflower workers will be incentivized to participate with a monetary payment.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: 	People who send in pictures will need the ability to judge if something is broken or not. They would only need the ability to keep their eyes out for broken items and identify them as such if they come across them. The Crowdflower workers would simply need to classify items based on how broken they appear to be.<p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: 	The pictures that are being sent in are hard to verify unless we did it by hand, which can be possible if it’s limited to a set of 200-300 pictures. Crowdflower worker quality can be tested with an initial quiz that shows their relative accuracy.<p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: 	We can use a simple API such as Twilio to allow people to text pictures to a phone number. The Crowdflower results can simply be aggregated into a spreadsheet and CSV file that we can download and compares the crowd answers to our labels.<p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: 	First, we have to gather a set of 50-100 images, either from the Internet of from buildings around Penn, of items that are broken and visibly need fixing and items that look fine, and we would classify themselves by hand. We would put this set up on Crowdflower and ask them to classify the images into “definitely needs fixing”, “might need fixing”, or “looks fine”. We’d then take the labels that Crowdflower gave us and compare them to our hand-given labels to verify that the crowd and our team have the same general definition of “broken”. <p>      Next, we would try building our own classifier with a large corpus of images based on the features that we observed to be important in our initial phase. Ideally, we’d want to deconstruct the image into certain vectors that can help indicate a broken item, like uneven lighting or uneven structure in the image. If that has limited success, we can still try and classify the images as broken or not based on their location or even by the person who sent the picture in, among other associated metadata. <p>	Finally, we’d put these set of images on Crowdflower again and compare our classifier’s performance with the actual labels the crowd workers give us. We could put our entire dataset up to get all statistics on precision and recall, or just put the images that our classifier selected as “definitely needs fixing”.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: 	Using a standard statistics like precision and recall. Also, we can try and find the average distance between the label vector and the crowd workers vector (the lower “distance”, the better). <p>
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: 	The biggest issue will be actually getting a critical mass of images for which to perform statistically significant machine learning on. One possible workaround is to extend the scope of the pictures to beyond just Penn’s campus, but that poses obvious problems with data sanity and standardization. I don’t think it’s infeasible to get the quick set of 50-100 images just to do an initial test for validation purposes. If we have a hard time just getting 50 images, then we may need to change our approach. Another big issue involves items that are broken internally, but that are not visible to the naked eye. We would try to discourage users from taking pictures of such items at the beginning, and maybe introduce them later once we have a solid model for visually broken items.<p>

  name_of_your_project: EbolAware
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: EbolAware determines how people are reacting to Ebola by analyzing data from social media.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem that we don't know how people react to things that are outside of their control and that don't immediately affect them. Ebola is a perfect case of this for most people. It is an epidemic happening on a different continent, yet it is a constant topic of discussion here in North America and on news outlets daily. Someone in the UN said that Ebola could be contained in 6 to 9 months but only if a massive global response was implemented. The start of a large scale global response is rooted in each individual's response to the crisis, and that is what I want to figure out more about. 
  what_similar_projects_exist: None that I know of, except polls on news websites about it. 
  what_type_of_project_is_it: social science experiment with social media
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: The workers on crowdflower.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Monetarily.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide a rating of the different emotions of the tweet that they are working on and the intensity of the emotion. For this they just need a working knowledge of English. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: I will have multiple people working on the same tweet in order to verify the results, and I will have sample tweets that I work on to compare to the answers of the workers.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: I will average all the data and then find the top ten sentiments about Ebola and rank them in order of average intensity. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: The first step is to crawl Twitter for tweets about Ebola, this will be done by me. The next step is to create a Crowdflower survey that takes several tweets, including a test one that I already know the general answer to, and gives it to a worker to gage the emotions and level of intensity of those emotions in the tweets. The last step is to aggregate and analyze the data, which I will do.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: I will consider this successful if by the end I have a result where there are recurring themes in people's tweets about Ebola, that the crowdworkers have noticed.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Judging the level of intensity of emotion within a tweet is very subjective, so I think having a consistent way for the workers to judge the tweets will be the most difficult problem to solve. Another problem might be that there are such wide ranges of emotions and intensity levels that there are no clear sentiments towards Ebola on Twitter.

  name_of_your_project: What Should I Cook?
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: This app attempts to solve the problems of all those people who have ever wondered, What should I cook? given a full fridge and no recipes.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Matching available ingredients for cooking to recipes made with those ingredients
  what_similar_projects_exist: Supercook, as far as I know, does this without the image recognition part
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone who can recognize food images
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Tasks that pay for typing in names of food recognized in images, much like the receipt tasks that dominate MT.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They provide training parameters for the OpenCV learner, no skills required
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Test questions would be used
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The plan involves using the MT or CF APIs to automate machine learning for the image recognition, aggregates would be the end result of each task batch.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowd&#58; responsible for looking at an image of food items and listing the items that are in the images (i.e. tomato, egg, watermelon, etc.)<p>Automated&#58; learn on sets of images to identify discrete foods, call the crowdsourcing API, download images from users, call BigOven API to look up recipes.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If the image recognition can effectively give back more than 50% of the discrete ingredients from a picture of the inside of a stocked refrigerator, I would call the project a success.<p>On a more qualitative note, the project would be successful if the data flow from image upload -> classifier -> recipe worked.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: OpenCV is difficult to work with, the time it would take to train a classifier for image recognition is non-trivial, and especially parsing out discrete food items from an image of an open fridge seems to be a very complex problem.<p>Crowdsourcing problems include faking data, not agreeing with the classifier, and costs.

  name_of_your_project: DesignMind
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: DesignMind attempts to crowdsource voting on company logos, giving users the feedback that they want on a logo's effectiveness without all that focus group testing.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Currently, brands find it difficult to know what makes a good logo and resort to lots of focus groups and A/B testing.  This is expensive and inefficient when crowdsourcing exists and the opinions of many can be decided very quickly.
  what_similar_projects_exist: 99designs.com crowdsources logo designs from designers and then lets brands pick from the end results, this would be somewhat the opposite of that but in the same vein.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Pay-per-vote task, looking at each logo image and deciding which one is best for a particular case.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide all of the aggregate data that is returned to the user; basically, DesignMind attempts to be a gateway for companies to reach many people at once and get their thoughts and opinions.  They won't need any skills, since anyone could be a potential customer.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: One of the reach goals might be to implement worker filtering, so that some companies could target their desired audience for votes.  Otherwise, the quality of the crowd shouldn't be a problem since the only data needed is the vote.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Using the MT or CF APIs to gather the information and then present that back to the brand.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowd&#58; responsible for voting on logo designs, choosing which one is better<p>Automated&#58; uploading design images, sending tasks out to workers, aggregating results, displaying results to brands, targeting different audiences.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The project will be successful if the flow from app to task back to app works as expected and is quick enough for a potential customer to get feedback in a short amount of time.  Also, the success will depend on how expensive it ends up being to get a good chunk of aggregated data, versus the classic focus group cost.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: One problem could be that after pushing out the logo vote task, it takes too long to return any results.  Another would be the cost of the task itself, and yet another is the fact that brands still have to come up with their own logos in the first place in order to upload them.

  name_of_your_project: Campus Cribs
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Market for Finding and Trading off-campus houses on campus.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Every year, a new class of rising juniors seeks off-campus housing. The outgoing seniors can either pass their lease down to a group of their choosing or let the realtors decide who gets the house. In addition, the rising seniors often opt to look for a different off-campus house that will better suit their needs the following year. Right now, all of these people either have to know someone who's house will be up for lease or have to go to one of the campus realtors to find options.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Currently, Rental companies exist which pair buyers and sellers of houses, as well as renters and landlords. However, as far as we know, there is no service that helps students see all of their off-campus options in one place.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn undergraduates and graduate students.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: The algorithm will be individually rational, meaning that the users are guaranteed to exit the process with a house that either meets or exceeds the house that they go into the process with. If they don't find a better one, they keep their own. The program will collect features of their house and their preferences for a new one. It will match users for hand-offs and even for trades.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will need access to the internet and a upenn.edu email address.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The users will have no incentive to lie about what their house offers because if they do and find a potential trade, the other party will quickly realize the falseness of the first party's offering and the first party will not get the trade they wanted.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will allow users to sign up for the service and create a profile for bother their own house and the housing options they seek.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: First, users sign up and create personal preference profiles and profiles of their current house, including location, amenities, bedrooms, bathrooms, prices, condition, etc. They are then entered into a pool of other options on campus. If a match between their preferences and another house occurs, the two parties are connected automatically. If a potential three or more way trade occurs, the trade will be suggested to all of the parties automatically. If the trade is accepted, the users can take their houses off the market. We can collect data about offers and then sell that data to the landlords. This will be useful information for them about the demand for each of their properties, and will allow them to rethink pricing to match that demand.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We will collect data surrounding how often matches are made and how often those trades are accepted.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Consumer adoption may be a problem, especially because by the time we finish implementing the platform a lot of the properties will be signed for next year.
