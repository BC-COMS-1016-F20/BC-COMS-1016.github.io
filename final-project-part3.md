Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 3</span> 
=============================================================

This week's assignment is optional.  It doesn't count toward your final grade, but it's a nice milestone on the road to your final project. We highly encourage you to participate. 

The final project is due on Monday December 15th.  By that time, your system will need to be fully operational, and you'll have to have collected enough data to do an interesting analysis.  You can either collect data by employing a real crowd, or by having your classmates simulate the crowd.  On Monday December 8th, we'll have a catered dinner / hackathon after the final NETS 213 lecture.  During the hackathon, you will try out each other's projects, with the goal of creating some data that you can use to analyze for your final project.

What you should do to prepare:

* Get a working prototype ready
* Be sure that it is capable of collecting data from the crowd.
* Write a step-by-step README that shows your classmates how to use your system.
* Think about what sort of analysis you want to do.  
	- Do you want to compare your system against an existing non-crowdsourcing method?  
	- Do you want to analyze how accurate the crowd is at making predictions?
	- Do you want to test how well your method could scale in terms of time/money?
* Make sure that your capturing the appropriate information so that you can do your analysis.
