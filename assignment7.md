Literature Review<span class="text-muted"> : Assignment 7</span> 
=============================================================
For this week's assignment, you will start by reading over the [peer reviews of your 3 project ideas]() and then pick one of them to pursue as your final project.  After that, you'll do a literature review of academic papers that are relevant to your final project idea.  You can either work as a team to put together the literature review, or submit it as individuals.  The requirements for the lit review are:

* You should review the chapter or section of [The Wisdom of Crowds](http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414173519&sr=8-1&keywords=the+wisdom+of+crowds) that is most relevant for your project.  
* You should additionally review a number of academic papers.  The number of academic papers that you must review is equal the number of people in your team.  If you're doing the lit review as an individual rather than with a group, then you will need to review 1 academic paper + a selection from The Wisdom of Crowds.
* One of your academic papers must be drawn from the [course syllabus](http://crowdsourcing-class.org/syllabus.html).  The remaining academic papers can either be drawn from the syllabus or from [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).  
* All of the academic papers that you review should published in a peer reviewed conference or a journal, and not in magazine or blog.

You will answer [these questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e-TW-5UKudTFZeeTL8msvZSUQAsttzA0MkW8Aoz8mcw/viewform?usp=send_form) about the papers and book chapter that you reviewed.
