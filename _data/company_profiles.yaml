  what_company_are_you_profiling: MealKu
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.mealku.com/<p>http://www.jamieoliver.com/us/foundation/jamies-food-revolution/news-content/mealku-sharing-homemade-meals-online<p>http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/leftovers-made-to-share-with-strangers/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1<p>http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577500800856082254<p>http://www.today.com/food/do-you-mealku-potluck-craze-sweeps-home-kitchens-1C8613219<p>http://analisfirstamendment.blogspot.com/2012/08/interview-with-ted-dcruz-young-founder.html
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Nope.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Meal co-op for exchanging homemade meals within your city.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.mealku.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: July 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Ted D'Cruz-Young
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not really. I young hippie do-gooder kind of founder who wanted to come up with an organization to promote eating healthy, local food and reduce food waste. The founder also started a marketing agency called Ideocracy.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Mealku is basically a middleman that helps its members exchange food. Since there is no cost to receiving food, Mealku tracks points so that members have to put into the co-op (usually by providing food, but also by providing reviews and being active on the site) in order to receive food from the co-op. It also provides bicycle deliverymen and storage containers to transport the food from cook to consumer.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Fast food deliver/take-out. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.eatwith.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Health- and environment-conscious urban people. They say the goal is to make healthy food affordable, but it looks like you need a decent amount of cooking time and space in order to cook for other people, so I would imagine that most of the users are middle class. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users and the contributors are the same crowd. You have to provide food in order to receive food. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People don't join unless they want to provide food. It is as much a community of hippie foodies as it is a way of getting free meals.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Kitchen inspections, user reviews, and peer pressure.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: The gov't doesn't currently regulate food exchanges that are not monetary. Mealku makes an effort to check that the cooks' kitchens are not cesspools of waste, but it mostly operates on the trust system. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Users can rate the meals they receive, both using a star system over several criteria (food quality, portion size, etc) and by leaving free form comments. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: You only get points if others sign up to receive your food, and you can't receive food if you don't have points, so the crowd can end up filtering out the people who are making poor contributions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: ~1500 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Not very well. It depends on a local, trust-based community. It could probably scale well to many local organizations in many different cities, like a franchise model.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Users sign up, pay a monthly fee to cover deliver and packaging. Then they post meals they intend to cook (about 3 days before they intend to do so). If people sign up to receive those meals (paying points to do so) then the cook prepares them as promised, a Mealku delivery biker comes to their house with to pick up the packaged food, and brings it to the person who ordered it. The person who ordered can review the cook online afterward. The cook receives points for having provided food.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Some articles touch on the possible health and safety concerns, but it is not large enough to have attracted serious concerns. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They don't. It is a co-op, so they just need to stay afloat.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Kaggle
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle<p>http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/03/kaggle<p>http://theminingbook.blogspot.com/2014/03/kaggle-matches-companies-and-analysts.html<p>http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/industry/big-data<p>http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014018/the-rise-of-the-diy-data-scientist<p>http://www.wired.com/2011/12/kaggle/<p>http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kaggle
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.kaggle.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2010
  who_were_the_founders: Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founder, Anthony Goldbloom won an essay contest with The Economist and did a three month internship in the Finance and Economics Section. Here, he was writing about big data and in the process came up with the idea behind Kaggle. After the internship he taught himself to code at night and eventually created Kaggle 1.0.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Kaggle offers a a framework for the competition, consulting service for the host to prepare the data and the description of the problem, anonymize the data, and integrate the winning model into their operations.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces tech consulting firms since through this platform, even companies without internal data science teams can come up with predictive models for the problems they had.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: CrowdANALYTIX<p>DataKind
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Researchers and organizations like NASA, Microsoft, Heritage Provider Network use this service. An example would be NASA's cosmological image analysis competition for mapping dark matter. Here, the participants were provided with images of 100,000 galaxy and star pairs, then based on the tiny distortions in the images, they were to provide an estimate for the ellipticity for each galaxy.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Students and data scientists from over 100 countries and 200 universities. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Prize money and test data are some incentives. Some people use Kaggle to meet, learn, network and collaborate with experts from related fields.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: n some senses, the service provided is self-regulated in terms of quality. Since the incentivize structure is set up as a competition, there would really be no point in entering the competition if you aren't going to make an honest attempt at the problem. It is technically possible that all the data scientists could collude, submit bogus solutions, and split the prize amongst themselves without doing any real work, but considering a large part of the incentive structure has to do with the challenge and glory of the competitions, this is not very likely.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Kaggle users are allocated points for their performance in competitions. The overall user rankings are then shown on their website. Kaggle also separates its users into 3 tiers - novice, Kaggler, and master. Each tier is demarcated by a different color profile.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Kaggle presents problems in competition form, so many teams compete against one another to come up with the best solution to the problem. Although the teams are competing against one another, Kaggle is a way for some of the top minds to collaborate with others from all over the world, and the forum on Kaggle provides a great way for knowledge- and idea-sharing to take place.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 200,000 data scientists (contributors); at any time, there will be around 10-15 competitions (hosted by users)
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Up to $3 million in prize money
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Our initial thought was that, because a decent proportion of the Kagglers are Ph.D.'s, there would be an upper limit to the number of Kagglers that could be drawn in join these competitions. However, upon further research, one article revealed that the typical competition winner on Kaggle is self-taught. With this in mind, and given the potential generous size of the prizes (up to $300 an hour) and the "fun" aspect of the competitions, we feel that Kaggle's ability to attract the necessary talent to solve these problems would scale up quite well without sacrificing quality of the data scientists. Similarly, given the rise of "big data" and the associated need for data analysis, we feel that the number of companies and institutions funding these projects, and hence the incentive scheme, would similarly scale up well (more projects, more available prize money). Another point to make is that a lot of the scientists are incentivized by the challenge and the glory Kaggle presents (as opposed to the money), all of which would remain (if not intensify) if Kaggle were to scale up.None that we are aware of
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When a company/institution has a predictive data problem they would like solved, they can create a simplified (or not) version of the problem and create a competition for it, offering a prize of their choosing for the winner. The competition is then posted on the competition board on Kaggle, where the contributors (Kagglers) can choose to tackle the problem by forming teams and signing up for the competition. Each team's ranking is tracked in real-time throughout the duration of the competition, and when the time for the competition is up, the winning team gets awarded whatever prize was offered, and each user is rewarded his/her respective points for completing the competition.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: None that we are aware of
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kaggle charges a fixed fee to those hosting the competitions and also gets a proportion of prize money.

  give_a_url_for_the_companys_logo: http://bornski.com/matt/quirky.png
  what_company_are_you_profiling: Quirky
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.quirky.com/how-it-works<p>many sub-sites of quirky.com<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/technology/quirky-hopes-wink-will-speed-adoption-of-smart-home-products.html?_r=0
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I contributed to an invention - I shared my views on pricing of several already-pitched ideas. I very nearly ordered a fancy cutting board, then remembered that I am a college student and cook something gourmet about once per semester. 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Quirky crowdsources idea generation for new inventions, evaluation of that idea's feasibility and quality, and then manufactures and sells those inventions on their site.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.quirky.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Ben Kaufman
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Quirky arose when the founder's first business attempts at 18 years old failed miserably. He later decided that he could make invention and entrepreneurship more accessible by providing the platform for manufacturing, pricing, and sale - bringing the ideas of others to life. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: For inventors, they pay for the genius of the crowd - they take your idea, let other people vote to determine the best, use a crowd of experts to select one each week for manufacture, then use non-experts to determine price points and decide design questions. Their employees manufacture it. <p>For consumers, they sell devices that improve life in some way - modular power strips solve the problem of large plug-ins blocking other ports, internet-connected piggy banks make saving money trackable and fun, and a plethora of cord and desk organizers, among many others. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It's a smaller-scale incubator, where the inventor isn't expected to have technical skills or marketing prowess. Quirky takes in an idea, uses people to evaluate its merit, then makes and sells it based on price points provided by the crowd. <p>What makes Quirky unique is that it pays people to be influencers rather than simply inventors - no other site incorporates the crowd so well. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: SeedStudio Wishes<p>RocketHub<p>GeniusCrowds<p>Nest<p>KickStarter<p>IndieGoGo<p>EdisonNation
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Anyone, from a suburban mom to a seasoned patent-holder, could pitch an idea for an invention - their bare minimum is a one-sentence description, not a technical write-up or elevator pitch. Anyone, anywhere, can "influence" the inventions by deciding details on it or voting for the highest-quality ideas. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: There are no limitations or criteria preventing anyone from contributing, in an inventor or influencer role. In practice, inventors seem to be younger people who have encountered a problem repeatedly. There is no data released on influencers. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The company pays inventors - the people who pitch the original idea - 4.2% of the revenue of the product, assuming the product is manufactured and sold. It is easier to be an influencer; you can weigh in on design and price details of a product that is guaranteed to be rolled out, though of course your contribution is much less. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Interestingly, at Quirky the crowd regulates itself via a voting system for ideas. However, there is involvement from experts (retailers, manufacturers, marketers) when, each Thursday night, the company meets and picks the next idea to manufacture. People weigh in on design concerns, and at the end of the night, the physical crowd (mixed between experts and non-experts) votes on whether or not they will manufacture something. If more than half of the crowd votes yes, the founder has committed to moving it to production. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Typically, the government would protect the interests of investors by providing some type of intellectual property right. Quirky does not give credit to investors, but rather purchases the rights to an idea if they decide to use it, passing a share of the revenue along to the investor. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: N/A
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Contributions are aggregated via a simple majority. The most votes for non-quantitative options and the simple mean for quantitative options determine design specifications and prices, even product names. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Quirky has nearly one million contributors, and has released 344 products since 2009.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Quirky has projected $100 million in earnings in 2014.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: It would likely work better the larger the crowd becomes. There would be more ideas proposed, and, assuming patient and thorough voters, the best would rise to the top, where a larger crowd would ensure better price points, names, and color choices. The quality would improve and Quirky would likely benefit from an even larger customer base. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service does not seem to be advertised on any external sites, only on the shopping portal itself. If you decide to "invent," you are brought to a form to describe your idea. Once that is completed, "influencers" can vote to indicate their favorite design ideas. Then the Quirky team decides whether or not they will produce it, at which point influencers can vote for design specifications, name, prices, etc. <p>Both inventors and influencers receive a fraction of the revenue if Quirky decides to produce it. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I want to work for them! In a real, employee-type-way, not as an influencer. Being an inventor would be cool too. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: According to an anonymous forum site, they promise to pay inventors 40%, but in reality only pay 4.2% of revenue. This is probably because they also compensate influencers. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company sells the devices after they are pitched, assessed, priced, and designed by the crowd. Quirky manufactures the devices, sometimes for sale on their website, sometimes in partnership with retail giants like Home Depot.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No, although I've used its service before.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Netflix is a media business, mainly focused on renting DVDs and unlimitedly streaming movies and TV shows.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.netflix.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 1997
  who_were_the_founders: Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Supposedly, Hastings came up with the idea for Netflix when he was charged $40 for late fees on a very late copy of Apollo 13. <p>(**ppt&#58; Hastings got charged $40 for late fees - wasn't happy **)
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Internet video streaming and disc rental.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: They started with only an online disc rental service, which was pay per rental. After this, they added a subscription based service. From there, they drop the pay per rental and progressed to the internet streaming later on.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The company Quickflix is an Australian company of similar design, focusing on online movie rentals and their distribution<p>The company GameFly, which was modeled after Netflix, is similar except for online video games instead of movies.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: People of all ages, including families and students will use this in lieu of going to their local rental movie place (which are all but nonexistent anymore). I've personally used this service to catch up on old TV series and watch movies that I either haven't seen before, or wanted to watch on a whim, opposed to planning a whole movie night and segmenting time to go and pick up a movie from BlockBuster or a RedBox. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The contributers of the service are the same people who purchase subscriptions to Netflix and watch the movies and TV shows
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: They are incentived not explicitly, but rather implicity by the results of the contributions. People's recommendations help rank what movies they enjoy, and help Netflix give suggestions for movies or shows they would probably like to see.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Controversially, they have purchased "highways" of bandwidth, partnering with certain internet providers, so that their streaming service won't be interrupted or hampered.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: They are aggragated according to an algorithm. This algorithm has changed a lot in recent years, and Netflix even offered a $1,000,000 prize to a person/team who could up with an algorithm that beats their current one by 10% for guessing what TV shows and movies people would watch.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: On the order of 50 million users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: The operating income is $228 million where the total assets are $5.4 billion.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Netflix is primarily an English site, showing English movies, with the option of other languages subtitles as well as some small selection of foreign movies. Therefore, to scale up by 10 times, to ~500 million users, would hit the limit of English speakers of the world (currently ~430 million), so they would be limited by that factor. Their incentive scheme is already scaled to such a high number, that I don't believe it needs scaling, although the quality and aggregation model might need to adapt to more worldwide users, especially where people come from different cultures, even if speaking English, and consider how it may affect their contributions.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised heavily through internet ads, commercial TV ads, as well as word of mouth. Contributors contribute by rating a movie or show on a 5 star system through the site, prompted after they watch it. Users in the end get an aggregation from other users of the popularity of certain movies and how that might relate to their preferences. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: They've had some contoversies about throttling of DvDs, perhaps "unfairly" buying out of the highway lanes of the internet in order to provide their service quickly, as well as some social media support that they later dropped.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They generate revenue through the subscriptions of their customers.
