Resources 
=============================================================

###General Python resources

- Python itself has good documentation and a decent getting started page [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html).


###More advanced Python resources 

- Boto (Python's library for MTurk) is available on github. There is decent (although not perfect) documentation [here]() and a good tutorial available [here]().
- Scikit-learn is an amazingly easy library for doing machine learning in Python. It is also wonderfully verbosely documented with tons of examples [here]().
- [NLTK]() is a great library for doing natural language processing in Python.
