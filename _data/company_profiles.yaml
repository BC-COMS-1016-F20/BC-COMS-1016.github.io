  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: 1. Power Users -.  They spend inordinate amounts of time contributing to the website.  They might be moderating categories on Wikipedia, writing 100's of restaurant / bar reviews on Yelp, checking-in and commenting on ever Foursquare venue or even writing entire transcriptions of TV shows on ViiKii.net.  Or let's face it - writing lots of answers on Quora<p>2. Casual Contributors - These people are uninterested in achieving status on your website.  They had a very positive or negative experience and they want to tell the world.  They are passionate about a topic (like this one for me!) and they feel inclined to spend some time contributing.  <p>3. Lurkers.  Most UGC sites try to spend time converting lurkers to contributors.  Don't.  90% of all users will never contribute anything to your company.  They are there to ingest content.  <p><p><p>

  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Foursquare tries to ensure the privacy of its users.Privacy is integral to a company like foursquare.<p>Foursquare's Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we'll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips).

  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Most users access Foursquare with an application loaded on their smartphones, but it's also possible to update the service on your movements through the Foursquare Web site or by sending a text message. After you have signed up for a free account on the company's Web site and installed the application on your phone, you can activate the program any time you visit a location. Foursquare accesses your phone's GPS receiver to pinpoint your position and then lists nearby locations. After you choose which place you are visiting, the application updates your status to let other users know. If you update your status at the same location enough times, you can even earn badges or become the "mayor" of that location. Users can also use the location information to plan face-to-face meetings
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Jason Stamper, editor of Computer Business Review, has criticised Foursquare for what he says is its lax attitude to privacy protection, describing the potential risks as "terrifying". Stamper's principal criticism is that Foursquare's default position on privacy is that users must "opt-out" if they don't want any of their location-based details broadcast to friends and the wider world. Of course, Foursquare would be rendered virtually useless as a tool if a user did this so there is typically always some form of data exposure occurring when someone uses Foursquare. As has been repeatedly shown before with Facebook, the risks will often boil down to whether you really know who your "friends" are.
