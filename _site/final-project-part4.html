<p>The end is in sight.  This will be the final deliverable for NETS 213.  This assignment will be worth 20% of your final grade.  The goals of the final deliverables are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Show off what you did and why it is cool</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrate how it relates to the course and what you learned</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze your results- is it better than similar/existing approaches? What more could be done?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-video">Final Video</h3>

<p>On the day of the final exam, you will each have 5 minutes to wow everyone with your finished product. And, being a recurring theme of the course, we will ask you to do so in a 5 minute video. You all have a lot of work to showcase in those 5 minutes, so you keep it crisp and on-point. Your video should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Motivate the problem you are trying to solve or question you are trying to answer, and why crowdsourcing is an especially good fit for solving/answering it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give a quick background on related probelms. Have others tried to solve the same problem? What makes your approach different/better?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demo your solution/product. If you built an app, show it off in all its glory; if you conducted a scientific study, explain your procedure and demo the crowd-facing components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe your method/algorithm. Make sure you address the issues of incentivization, quality control, and aggregation. Which components you focus on will differ depending on your project, so you don’t have to give each one equal weight. Touch on each one, but focus on the part that was the most challenging or required the most creativity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discuss your results. Convince us that what you did “worked”. What is the take-away? </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some other tips for making your video awesome: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your video should be able to stand alone; someone with no knowledge of the class should be able to watch it and understand what you did and why it was a worthwhile thing to do. This will make it a more rewarding capstone of your work this semester. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every project is different- focus on what makes yours cool/interesting/exciting/impressive. If yours was engineering-heavy, spend the majority of the time on step (3). If yours was more scientific, you should spend the majority of the video on (5). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show, don’t just tell. Demos of working apps or figures of analyzed results are gold. Don’t just use your voice-over to read words off of a slide. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-questionnaire">Final Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Five minutes is short, and we want you do use your video to showcase what is great about what you did. So to make sure you still get credit for all the obligatory parts, and because it is only fitting, we will have you fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SndUhVcdVr1DI10tEML6gKxMrh4tBz5LZ7hVbOaBeqQ/viewform?usp=send_form">a detailed final questionnaire</a>. The questions will look familiar - its okay to reiterate points you made on past checkpoints, but highlight what about your original plan changed in your final product. </p>

<p>The questions we will ask, includes questions about these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What problem you are solving/question you are answering</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How you attempted to solve/answer it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How did you address each of the following: incentivization, aggregation, QC</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you project work? How do you know so? Analyze some results, discuss some positive outcomes of your project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the biggest challenges you had to deal with? What changed between your original plan and your final product?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some limitations of your product. If yours is an engineering-heavy project, what would you need to overcome in order to scale (cost/incentives/QC…)? If yours was a scientific study, what are some sources of error that may have been introduced by your method. If you results deviate from previous work, why might that be?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The questionnaire has questions asking you to do a deeper analysis of the individual components of your project. You should pick some number of these, and do an analysis. For each of the analysis questions, we ask you to create a Google graph using your skills from <a href="http://crowdsourcing-class.org/assignment9.html">the last homework assignment</a>. The number of questions you should pick depends on where the balance of your team’s effort went.  Some people are building really complex system that require a lot of engineering.  Other people’s focus is on analyzing data.  If your focus is on analysis, then you should generate more graphs. </p>

<h3 id="your-code">Your code</h3>

<p>Make sure all of your code is in your github repository. You will need to provide a link to your repository, as well as to specific files, in the questionnaire. Your repository <b>must contain a docs/ directory</b> with the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>README file</b> explaining the directory structure of your repository and what each script does. Be obscenely verbose and clear about where everything is and what it does. If we can’t find the code you are talking about, we cannot grade it accurately (or at all). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Flow diagram</b>: You should update the flow diagram from your previous submission to outline the major components/stages of your final product, and how they depend on each other. This should contain somewhere an aggregation module and a quality control module. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Screenshots/figures</b> You should include a short written “demo” of your project in PDF format. For the engineering-heavy projects, this can be simply a walk-through of all of the use-cases of your app. If yours is a more scientific study, your PDB should include your figures and analyses of your results. Your full written discussion will be in the questionnaire, but your PDF writeup is meant to keep all of your visual aides (screenshots, tables, charts, etc.) in one place. Your figures should be clearly labeled and captioned. You can and should point to these figures in your responses in the questionnaire.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The final project is due on Monday December 15th.  The presentations will be from 3pm-5pm in Berger Auditorium room 101 in Skirkanich Hall. You must work in groups on this project.  You must declare who is in your group when you turn your assignment.  Everyone in your group will receive the same grade on the assignment. </p>
