  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Our website will crowdsource food delivery.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem of a demand for food delivery from restaurants that do not offer a delivery option.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Instacart is the closest thing.  They are still different, however.  Instacart hires employees and handles delivery of groceries, alcohol, and other bulk purchase items, but crucially not already made food.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: It will likely be college students look for food, money, or both.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Those who deliver food will get the bonus of working whenever they want to, delivering joy to those in their community, and of course the delivery fee.  Those who order food will get their food delivered to their door, at the time they want it, and for an agreed upon delivery fee.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: Some will provide the delivery service, needing only the skill of buying food and walking to an address.  Others will provide the demand for food, and they need nothing but an appetite and laziness.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Quality will be ensured by ratings that delivery users will rate customers on a few metrics, and customers will rate aspects of the delivery process.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Results from the crowd will be used to filter feeds for both the delivery user, and customers so that poorly rated users won't be matched again.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: To begin with, users can either post requests for food deliveries, or post opportunities for others to get food delivered.  If there is a match between users looking for food, and users going to get food soon, then they will be automatically asked to settle on a delivery fee.  Once this is set, delivery users will go buy the food and deliver it to the customer who will pay the delivery person on venmo.  Then, the customers will be asked to rate the delivery person on quality, speed, price, and kindness.  The delivery user will then be asked to rank the customer on clarity of request, fairness of the pay, and kindness.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: Our project is successful if users from both sides of the service can sign up, log in, post requests and opportunities, fulfill requests, deliver, accept delivery fees, and rate their experience.  This will determine a successful project, but a successful business would need to create a platform with steady demand and supply.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Not finding enough users to build demand or supply.  Having difficulty implementing all of the above features in time for the project's completion.  Communicating the benefits to both types of users.  Figuring out the payment flow might also prove difficult.  Ensuring quality will also be hard to do.

  name_of_your_project: Critic Critic
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: It will compare media representation based on political party, age, gender, or race.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: There are inconsistencies in how people of different walks of life are described for the same actions or beliefs. However, when these inconsistencies are addressed, it is written off as a small-scale problem with one news network or anchor. Compiling a large volume of data about these representations could help to address media bias and unfair representation. <p>For an explicit example&#58;<p>http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/09yfp5/the-broads-must-be-crazy---belittled-women
  what_similar_projects_exist: Miss Representation is a documentary that discusses how men and women are portrayed differently in politics, but it draws on a lot of anecdotal evidence, and does not discuss political parties, age, or race.

  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Crowdflower Workers

  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide an assessment of the demographic background and the name of the subject of an article. They need to be able to read in English, as we will be focusing on American media. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will create a volume of test data to quiz them, and then cross-check their answers with known data about popular politicians. If they identify Barack Obama as a young white female, we can discard their responses. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will use their identifications of, for example, black politicians, to run our feature-maker and gather our most commonly used descriptors. If there is conflict over the subject (i.e., multiple politicians referenced equally), we will not use that article in our responses. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Step one&#58; crawl the web (can we borrow your web crawler?) for articles about politicians. <p>Step two&#58; ask crowdflower workers to identify the demographics of the subject of each article. <p>Step three&#58; sort (via the spreadsheet produced by crowdflower) the articles into demographic groups (male vs. female, black vs. white vs. Hispanic)<p>Step four&#58; run our script to extract features on each separate set<p>Step five&#58; look at the results
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If we have comprehensible keywords for each group that are useful for analysis (not stopwords), we will consider it a success. <p>If our data indicates that the same words are used along party lines, or across gender lines, we'll consider that a success for humanity and chalk media bias up to isolated incidences. 
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Articles that mention multiple politicians will confuse the crowd. The crowd may be unable to identify a subject's political party by the context of an article if the source assumes familiarity with this information. Focusing on American politics will probably limit crowd familiarity, and may limit effectiveness of the crowd if they are rushing through the articles.
