Market Research <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 2</span> 
=============================================================
Enough talk, this week we will start writing some code. This assignment is designed to be a crash-course to get you up to speed on the level of Python you will need to know in order to do the remainder of the assignments. For those of you that already know Python, great. For those that do not, its easiest to learn by doing, so please start early so we can help you get on board so that you can focus on the crowdsourcing and machine learning, not the indenting and semicoloning. 

The deliverable for this assignment will be a single script, <code>bootcamp.py</code>. Running your file should print the answers to each of the below questions, one per line. Your answers will be graded automatically, so it is important that the file is formatted correctly. (I.e. Make sure you remove all your debug print statements before submitting!)


###The basics

###File IO

###Text processing

###Machine learning in Python


Your code is due <b>Wednesday, September 17</b>. Please submit it via <code>turnin</code> from the eniac machines.
