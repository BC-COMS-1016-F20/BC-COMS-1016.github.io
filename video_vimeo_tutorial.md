##Creating Videos
###The Technical Bit
There are a variety of ways of making videos. Two of the easiest and most effective are:
* Using a handheld camera to film a live presentation (think iPhone camera)
* Using a screen recording software to record your screen and audio

#####Option 1: Handheld camera
1. Take your favorite camera or more likely, favorite smartphone and record your presentation. 
2. Upload it to your laptop and you're all set!

#####Option 2: Screen recording
If you're on a Mac:

1. Open up QuickTime
2. Go to File->New Screen Recording
3. It'll give you the option to record the whole screen or just a part of the screen, and then start recording
4. You can record your screen and audio at the same time, and voila, you have a presentation on video!

If you're on Windows:
Check out this [screen recording software](http://icecreamapps.com/Screen-Recorder/).

Sidenote: There are so many interesting and engaging ways to present ideas through videos. Explosions, interpretive dance and funky tunes are only a few of the things you can do with video that you can't with a boring old powerpoint(not that powerpoints aren't effective). You should strive to create something that's informative, but also memorable and entertaining. It'll make peer grading that much more enjoyable for everyone, and you'll have a lot more fun making it!  

##Uploading to Vimeo

1. Sign up for a Vimeo account following the instructions on their [website](https://vimeo.com/).
2. You will receive and email with a link to verify your account, after which you can upload a video.
3. Navigate to the site, login and click the big blue upload button in the top right corner, you'll be prompted to upload your video. 
4. After choosing a file to upload, you'll end up at a page with all the details of your video. Format your title as the name of the project/company_homeworknumber, and make sure the privacy settings allow anyone to see the video.
5. After uploading the video vimeo will tell you that it's going through some technical process to format the video, and after that you should be all set!
