  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company: MealKu is a co-op for exchanging homemade meals within your city.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.mealku.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: July 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Ted D'Cruz-Young
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not really. I young hippie do-gooder kind of founder who wanted to come up with an organization to promote eating healthy, local food and reduce food waste. The founder also started a marketing agency called Ideocracy.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Mealku is basically a middleman that helps its members exchange food. Since there is no cost to receiving food, Mealku tracks points so that members have to put into the co-op (usually by providing food, but also by providing reviews and being active on the site) in order to receive food from the co-op. It also provides bicycle deliverymen and storage containers to transport the food from cook to consumer.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something_what_does_it_replace: Fast food deliver/take-out. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.eatwith.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Health- and environment-conscious urban people. They say the goal is to make healthy food affordable, but it looks like you need a decent amount of cooking time and space in order to cook for other people, so I would imagine that most of the users are middle class. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users and the contributors are the same crowd. You have to provide food in order to receive food. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People don't join unless they want to provide food. It is as much a community of hippie foodies as it is a way of getting free meals.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts__professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts__professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Kitchen inspections, user reviews, and peer pressure.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: The gov't doesn't currently regulate food exchanges that are not monetary. Mealku makes an effort to check that the cooks' kitchens are not cesspools of waste, but it mostly operates on the trust system. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so_how_does_it_work: Users can rate the meals they receive, both using a star system over several criteria (food quality, portion size, etc) and by leaving free form comments. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: You only get points if others sign up to receive your food, and you can't receive food if you don't have points, so the crowd can end up filtering out the people who are making poor contributions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_users: ~1500 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Not very well. It depends on a local, trust-based community. It could probably scale well to many local organizations in many different cities, like a franchise model.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised_and_how_the_contributors_contribute_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end: Users sign up, pay a monthly fee to cover deliver and packaging. Then they post meals they intend to cook (about 3 days before they intend to do so). If people sign up to receive those meals (paying points to do so) then the cook prepares them as promised, a Mealku delivery biker comes to their house with to pick up the packaged food, and brings it to the person who ordered it. The person who ordered can review the cook online afterward. The cook receives points for having provided food.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Some articles touch on the possible health and safety concerns, but it is not large enough to have attracted serious concerns. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They don't. It is a co-op, so they just need to stay afloat.

Around Thanksgiving, my mom called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone Iâ€™m bringing,â€ Matt recalls. â€œIn that moment I realized how great it would be to have an answer for her that didnâ€™t require me to actually be dating someone.â€
