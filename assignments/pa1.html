<h1>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation</h1>

<h2>Programming Assignment 1 : Due TBA</h2>

<p>In this assignment, we will be collecting data from Twitter which we will use to train our sentiment classifiers. Scraping Twitter for news and sentiment data has become a huge deal for businesses and researchers, and not <em>just</em> because people care about <a href="https://twitter.com/CatsPorn/status/367992670745927680/photo/1">kittens</a>. Governments and academics are interested in whether Twitter and other <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/miles/papers/short-breaking.pdf">social media can reveal breaking news</a> before news networks can, and <a href="http://www.sntmnt.com/">many investors</a>, despite all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_market_hypothesis">economic theory</a>, believe social media can help them beat the market. Being able to use Twitter data at scale is a great skill for graduating computer scientists and business-minded students, and not a bad starting point for those of you who want to get rich (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/19/billionaires-harvard-education-biz-billies-cx_af_0519billieu_slide_4.html">boost UPenn's ranking!</a>) and spend your 30s sipping cocktails on rooftop terraces.</p>

<p>We are providing you with code that makes it very easy to search Twitter for keywords and grab the ones you want, but we encourage you to play around with the code and extend it. We will be using <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/tweepy/html/index.html">tweepy</a>, which, like all python packages, is hosted on github, is well documented, and has a cutesy name involving 'py'.   </p>

<ol>
<li> Download and install tweepy from <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy">github</a>. If you have never installed code from github before, its very easy. Just open a terminal and run the following commands:

<ul>
<li><code>$ git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git</code>
<li><code>$ cd tweepy</code>
<li><code>$ sudo python setup.py install</code>
<li>type pas$word123, or whichever other unhackable password you are using.
</ul>

<li> Download our <a href="downloads/get_tweets.py">script</a> for pulling data from Twitter using tweepy. (Courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/ryancotterell">Ryan Cotterall</a>, guru of all things python).

<li> To run the script in the command line, use the following command where <code>n</code> is (optionally) the maximum number of tweets to grab and keywords are the words you want to search for. You must give at least one keyword. If you leave out the <code>n</code> parameter, you will continue to get tweets in a stream until you kill the program. Note that the program will stop after <i>roughly</i> <code>n</code> tweets. It won't be exact.
<ul>
<li><code>$ python get_tweets.py [n] keyword1 [keyword2 ... keywordn]</code></li>
</ul>


<li> Collect 1000 tweets which reference a company of your choice.

<ul>
<li><code>$ python get_tweets.py 1000 Apple > apple_tweets.txt </code></li>
</ul>

<li> Grab a random sample of 100 tweets and manually label them for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). You will use your own labels later to check that Turkers are doing their work well (or at least as well as you are).
<ul>
<li><code>$ cat apple_tweets.txt | shuf | head -100 > labeled_apple_tweets.txt </code></li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Here are some example tweets I got by searching for 'Apple'. </p>

<ul>
<li>Using apple headphones on my galaxy s4 surely this must be a crime?     LSudeene</li>
<li>I'm dying. In the apple store there is some guys with a beer bong       kristinrutty</li>
<li>Smoking Near Apple Computers Creates Biohazard, Voids Warranty http://t.co/mVyy65Zn5W via @wordpressdotcom      TisOsama</li>
<li>RT @RudeComedian: I hate it when I'm wearing my apple bottom jeans and I can't find my boots with the fur.      emmilyy_b</li>
<li>Apple patent points to NFC on next iteration of the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad http://t.co/0S2OyY6HHb  yushadi_sy</li>
<li>RT @HonestToddler: I mean, Apple Juice is wonderful, but Apple Sauce? Room temperature smoothie in a bowl. Failure.   LT_Kbyrne</li>
