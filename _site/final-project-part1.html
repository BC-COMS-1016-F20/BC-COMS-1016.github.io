  This assignment is due before class on Wednesday, October 8th.  You must work in groups on this project.  </div>

<h1 id="final-projectspan-classtext-muted--part-1span">Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 1</span></h1>

<p>This week’s assignment counts as a deliverable toward your final project.  This assignment will be worth 10% of your final grade.  The goal of this assignment is to generate several ideas that you could refine into your final project.  You’ll pitch the ideas in class, and get feedback from your classmates about how exciting and how feasible they think your ideas are.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-form-a-team">Step 1: Form a team</h3>

<p>Your final project must be done in a group.  The size of the group can be 2-4 people.  Find some awesome people.  Do you remember what James Surowiecki says about groups?  They’re best if they are composed of a diverse set of people.  So maybe you should try to pick out people who aren’t already your friends.  Use the <a href="https://piazza.com/class/hzdefdi7bbl3xg?cid=5">Piazza message board</a> to advertise that you’re looking for teammates. </p>

<h3 id="step-2-brainstorm-ideas-for-your-project">Step 2: Brainstorm ideas for your project</h3>

<p>Your group should meet up and brainstorm ideas for the project.  You can come up with ideas on your own, or use <a href="http://crowdsourcing-class.org/project.html">some of my ideas</a> as a starting point.  Your ideas are probably better than mine.</p>

<p>Here are some different kinds of projects that you could do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Come up with a human computation algorithm that solves some cool problem</li>
  <li>Conduct a social science experiment with the crowd or analyze data from social media</li>
  <li>Create tools that improve crowdsourcing platforms for requesters or for workers</li>
  <li>Develop a business idea that uses the crowd like in the companies that we’ve been profiling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3-flesh-out-3-ideas">Step 3: Flesh out 3 ideas</h3>

<p>As a group, pick the 3 ideas that you like the most and start fleshing them out. <br />
Here are some considerations that you should take into account when selecting your shortlist of ideas.  The final version of your project should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solve a real world problem</li>
  <li>Actually use crowdsourcing (it doesn’t have to be via CrowdFlower, but that is a good default way to incorporate crowdsourcing)</li>
  <li>Include a significant machine learning or human-computer interaction component, or another component that you can analyze quantitatively</li>
  <li>Explain the choice of incentives and discuss alternative ways of incentivizing workers</li>
  <li>Contain a quality control component</li>
  <li>Analyze costs and decide whether your idea is a viable business</li>
</ul>

<p>Your initial ideas don’t have to do all of these things yet, but they should be ideas that you can extend in that way.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-answer-questions-about-the-3-ideas">Step 4: Answer questions about the 3 ideas</h3>

<p>You will be asked to answer to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team members. (The team should be the same for all 3 projects).  </li>
  <li>Name for the project.  </li>
  <li>One sentence description of the project.</li>
  <li>What problem does it solve? </li>
  <li>What similar projects exist? </li>
  <li>What type of project is it? (Human computation algorithm, social science experiment with the crowd, a tool for crowdsourcing, a business idea that uses crowdsourcing)</li>
  <li>Who will be the members of your crowd? </li>
  <li>How will you incentivize them to participate?</li>
  <li>What will they provide, and what sort of skills do they need?</li>
  <li>How will you ensure the quality of the crowd provides? </li>
  <li>How will you aggregate the results from the crowd?</li>
  <li>Describe each of the steps involved in your process.  What parts will be done by the crowd, and what parts will be done automatically. </li>
  <li>How will you evaluate if your project is successful? </li>
  <li>What potential problems do you foresee when implementing your project?</li>
  <li>A link to your Vimeo video</li>
</ul>

<p>You should submit your answers to the question on <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MjPIdJVrGNCjzrvVspYIek7nW-mulxoVxiZnEKN3RJY/viewform?usp=send_form">the project pitch questionnaire</a>.  Please submit separate forms for each of your 3 ideas.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-create-video-pitches-for-each-of-your-3-ideas">Step 5: Create video pitches for each of your 3 ideas</h3>

<p>You should produce a 90 second to 2 minute video for each of your ideas.  The video should include slides that describe your project, along with a narrative that explains the project in an exciting, cogent way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first slide should include the name of your project, and a logo that denotes what happens in your project.  You can create a logo using the awesome icons from <a href="http://thenounproject.com">the NounProject</a>.</li>
  <li>The slides should clearly explain what your project idea is, and how it relates to the themes of the class.  What problem does it solve?  How does it use crowdsourcing?  Who is your crowd?  </li>
  <li>Your goals are to excite people about the project, and to convince us that your idea is feasible and that you have thought it through.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-6-present-your-ideas-in-class">Step 6: Present your ideas in-class</h3>

<p>We will play all of the videos in class on Wednesday October 8th and Monday October 15th. Battle Royale of ideas.  No live presentations this time, since we’ll be constrained for time.  You must have your Vimeo videos uploaded and your questionnaires submitted before class starts.  We’ll use the questionnaires to create a video playlist.  </p>

<p>We will also provide time for in-class questions.  The amount of time will depend on the number of teams.</p>

<h3 id="step-7-peer-grading">Step 7: Peer grading</h3>

<p>You will each be assigned a set of projects to review, and you’ll give feedback to your classmates on their ideas.  We will provide a set of criteria for you to use when evaluating the project ideas.  We will give you the questionnaires and videos for several projects for you to evaluate.  Peer grading will constitute 5% of your overall grade.  There will be several assignments that you will peer-review: this assignment, the company profiles, and the other parts of the final project.</p>

<p>This assignment is due before class on <b>Wednesday, October 8th</b>.  You must work in groups on this project.  You must declare who is in your group when you turn your assignment.  Everyone in your group will receive the same grade on the assignment. </p>
