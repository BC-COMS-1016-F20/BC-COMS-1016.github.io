Peer grading <span class="text-muted">: Project Pitch Feedback</span> 
=============================================================

As was pointed out during multiple project pitches, people love to pass judgement! Rather than feel guilty, put your judgemental side to good use: by critiquing your classmates' ideas!

This week's assignment is straightforward and should be pretty fun. Each of you has been assigned three project teams. You will need to look through each team's ideas, and give them thoughtful feedback on which ideas are good, which need work (and how), and ultimately, which you think they should pursue. Be kind but constructive; the point is to help your classmates create something worth creating. If the [Quirky](https://www.quirky.com/shop) model is any good, this should ensure that only awesome projects get produced, right?

The teams you've been assigned to review, as well as links to all the videos and questionnaire responses, are posted in a [note on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/hzdefdi7bbl3xg?cid=112). That should give you all the information you need to fill out [the questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_lKMER6u7MZK6lvtpcMfyHKEtouSmtM6GmF7gINljDU/viewform?usp=send_form). Each of you has been assigned 3 teams (i.e. 9 project pitches) to evaluate, but since teams turned in three separate videos and some combined into one video, some of you will see that you have more or fewer videos to watch than others. Trust us, the work load is even, we are not secretly playing favorites. 

After this assignment, each of you will receive the feedback on your own ideas from ~7 of your peers. You should take their feedback seriously as you move forward with your project. 

The only deliverable is your responses in the questionnaire.  You should submit the questionaire three times â€“ once for each team you are reviewing. This assignment is due <b>Wednesday, October 15</b>. You cannot work in pairs on this assignment.  Please do it by yourself.

Happy Fall break!
