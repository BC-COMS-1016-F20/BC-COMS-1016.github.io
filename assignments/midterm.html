<h1>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation</h1>

<h2>Midterm Presentation : Due Wednesday, October 9</h2>

<p>Its midterm time! The best part of the semester! As has been alluded to not-too-subtly during every lecture, we will being going the term-project route for both your midterm and your final. We are leaving the specifics of your project very open-ended; we want you to choose something that you are interested in and hopefully that you can take with you after the semester. Reread the guidelines for the final project on the <a href="../assignments.html">assignments page</a>, and feel free to email us if you are not sure whether your idea is on the right track. </p>

<p>For your midterm, you need to come up with an idea for your project and put together a 10 minute presentation / sales pitch which you will give in class on Wednesday, October 9th. You can work in teams of two if you want, and if you choose to do so, your team will give a joint presentation. Your presentation should address the following points:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
<li> Pitch your idea to the class! Sell it! Show us
    <ul class="bullets">
    <li> Why the idea is exciting
    <li> How the idea is relevant to the course
    </ul>
<li> Sketch the major components of the project
    <ul class="bullets">
    <li> Give a rough timeline. When do you plan to complete these components? 
    <li> If you are in a team, explain who will be responsible for which components.
    </ul>
<li> Keep in mind that your idea needs to be of appropriate scope. Strike a balance between ambitious enough to count as a final project and manageable enough to be doable by the end of the semester. A good approach is to outline a big-picture for your project, but plan to implement just a piece of it this semester. Tell us what you plan to implement and explain how the project could be taken further, once Google buys you out.
</ul>

<p>After your presentation, you will recieve suggestions and constructive criticism from your class. If you are excited by someone else's presentation and want to rearrange teams so you can collaborate, that is more than fine. All teams and projects ideas must be finalized and confirmed by Chris or myself by October 23rd.</p>
