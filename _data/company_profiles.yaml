  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.mealku.com/<p>http://www.jamieoliver.com/us/foundation/jamies-food-revolution/news-content/mealku-sharing-homemade-meals-online<p>http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/leftovers-made-to-share-with-strangers/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1<p>http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577500800856082254<p>http://www.today.com/food/do-you-mealku-potluck-craze-sweeps-home-kitchens-1C8613219<p>http://analisfirstamendment.blogspot.com/2012/08/interview-with-ted-dcruz-young-founder.html
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Nope.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Meal co-op for exchanging homemade meals within your city.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.mealku.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: July 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Ted D'Cruz-Young
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not really. I young hippie do-gooder kind of founder who wanted to come up with an organization to promote eating healthy, local food and reduce food waste. The founder also started a marketing agency called Ideocracy.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Mealku is basically a middleman that helps its members exchange food. Since there is no cost to receiving food, Mealku tracks points so that members have to put into the co-op (usually by providing food, but also by providing reviews and being active on the site) in order to receive food from the co-op. It also provides bicycle deliverymen and storage containers to transport the food from cook to consumer.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Fast food deliver/take-out. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.eatwith.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Health- and environment-conscious urban people. They say the goal is to make healthy food affordable, but it looks like you need a decent amount of cooking time and space in order to cook for other people, so I would imagine that most of the users are middle class. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users and the contributors are the same crowd. You have to provide food in order to receive food. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People don't join unless they want to provide food. It is as much a community of hippie foodies as it is a way of getting free meals.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Kitchen inspections, user reviews, and peer pressure.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: The gov't doesn't currently regulate food exchanges that are not monetary. Mealku makes an effort to check that the cooks' kitchens are not cesspools of waste, but it mostly operates on the trust system. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Users can rate the meals they receive, both using a star system over several criteria (food quality, portion size, etc) and by leaving free form comments. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: You only get points if others sign up to receive your food, and you can't receive food if you don't have points, so the crowd can end up filtering out the people who are making poor contributions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: ~1500 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Not very well. It depends on a local, trust-based community. It could probably scale well to many local organizations in many different cities, like a franchise model.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Users sign up, pay a monthly fee to cover deliver and packaging. Then they post meals they intend to cook (about 3 days before they intend to do so). If people sign up to receive those meals (paying points to do so) then the cook prepares them as promised, a Mealku delivery biker comes to their house with to pick up the packaged food, and brings it to the person who ordered it. The person who ordered can review the cook online afterward. The cook receives points for having provided food.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Some articles touch on the possible health and safety concerns, but it is not large enough to have attracted serious concerns. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They don't. It is a co-op, so they just need to stay afloat.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Kaggle
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle<p>http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/03/kaggle<p>http://theminingbook.blogspot.com/2014/03/kaggle-matches-companies-and-analysts.html<p>http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/industry/big-data<p>http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014018/the-rise-of-the-diy-data-scientist<p>http://www.wired.com/2011/12/kaggle/<p>http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kaggle
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.kaggle.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2010
  who_were_the_founders: Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founder, Anthony Goldbloom won an essay contest with The Economist and did a three month internship in the Finance and Economics Section. Here, he was writing about big data and in the process came up with the idea behind Kaggle. After the internship he taught himself to code at night and eventually created Kaggle 1.0.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Kaggle offers a a framework for the competition, consulting service for the host to prepare the data and the description of the problem, anonymize the data, and integrate the winning model into their operations.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces tech consulting firms since through this platform, even companies without internal data science teams can come up with predictive models for the problems they had.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: CrowdANALYTIX<p>DataKind
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Researchers and organizations like NASA, Microsoft, Heritage Provider Network use this service. An example would be NASA's cosmological image analysis competition for mapping dark matter. Here, the participants were provided with images of 100,000 galaxy and star pairs, then based on the tiny distortions in the images, they were to provide an estimate for the ellipticity for each galaxy.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Students and data scientists from over 100 countries and 200 universities. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Prize money and test data are some incentives. Some people use Kaggle to meet, learn, network and collaborate with experts from related fields.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: n some senses, the service provided is self-regulated in terms of quality. Since the incentivize structure is set up as a competition, there would really be no point in entering the competition if you aren't going to make an honest attempt at the problem. It is technically possible that all the data scientists could collude, submit bogus solutions, and split the prize amongst themselves without doing any real work, but considering a large part of the incentive structure has to do with the challenge and glory of the competitions, this is not very likely.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Kaggle users are allocated points for their performance in competitions. The overall user rankings are then shown on their website. Kaggle also separates its users into 3 tiers - novice, Kaggler, and master. Each tier is demarcated by a different color profile.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Kaggle presents problems in competition form, so many teams compete against one another to come up with the best solution to the problem. Although the teams are competing against one another, Kaggle is a way for some of the top minds to collaborate with others from all over the world, and the forum on Kaggle provides a great way for knowledge- and idea-sharing to take place.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 200,000 data scientists (contributors); at any time, there will be around 10-15 competitions (hosted by users)
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Up to $3 million in prize money
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Our initial thought was that, because a decent proportion of the Kagglers are Ph.D.'s, there would be an upper limit to the number of Kagglers that could be drawn in join these competitions. However, upon further research, one article revealed that the typical competition winner on Kaggle is self-taught. With this in mind, and given the potential generous size of the prizes (up to $300 an hour) and the "fun" aspect of the competitions, we feel that Kaggle's ability to attract the necessary talent to solve these problems would scale up quite well without sacrificing quality of the data scientists. Similarly, given the rise of "big data" and the associated need for data analysis, we feel that the number of companies and institutions funding these projects, and hence the incentive scheme, would similarly scale up well (more projects, more available prize money). Another point to make is that a lot of the scientists are incentivized by the challenge and the glory Kaggle presents (as opposed to the money), all of which would remain (if not intensify) if Kaggle were to scale up.None that we are aware of
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When a company/institution has a predictive data problem they would like solved, they can create a simplified (or not) version of the problem and create a competition for it, offering a prize of their choosing for the winner. The competition is then posted on the competition board on Kaggle, where the contributors (Kagglers) can choose to tackle the problem by forming teams and signing up for the competition. Each team's ranking is tracked in real-time throughout the duration of the competition, and when the time for the competition is up, the winning team gets awarded whatever prize was offered, and each user is rewarded his/her respective points for completing the competition.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: None that we are aware of
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kaggle charges a fixed fee to those hosting the competitions and also gets a proportion of prize money.

  give_a_url_for_the_companys_logo: http://bornski.com/matt/quirky.png
  what_company_are_you_profiling: Quirky
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.quirky.com/how-it-works<p>many sub-sites of quirky.com<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/technology/quirky-hopes-wink-will-speed-adoption-of-smart-home-products.html?_r=0
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I contributed to an invention - I shared my views on pricing of several already-pitched ideas. I very nearly ordered a fancy cutting board, then remembered that I am a college student and cook something gourmet about once per semester. 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Quirky crowdsources idea generation for new inventions, evaluation of that idea's feasibility and quality, and then manufactures and sells those inventions on their site.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.quirky.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Ben Kaufman
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Quirky arose when the founder's first business attempts at 18 years old failed miserably. He later decided that he could make invention and entrepreneurship more accessible by providing the platform for manufacturing, pricing, and sale - bringing the ideas of others to life. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: For inventors, they pay for the genius of the crowd - they take your idea, let other people vote to determine the best, use a crowd of experts to select one each week for manufacture, then use non-experts to determine price points and decide design questions. Their employees manufacture it. <p>For consumers, they sell devices that improve life in some way - modular power strips solve the problem of large plug-ins blocking other ports, internet-connected piggy banks make saving money trackable and fun, and a plethora of cord and desk organizers, among many others. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It's a smaller-scale incubator, where the inventor isn't expected to have technical skills or marketing prowess. Quirky takes in an idea, uses people to evaluate its merit, then makes and sells it based on price points provided by the crowd. <p>What makes Quirky unique is that it pays people to be influencers rather than simply inventors - no other site incorporates the crowd so well. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: SeedStudio Wishes<p>RocketHub<p>GeniusCrowds<p>Nest<p>KickStarter<p>IndieGoGo<p>EdisonNation
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Anyone, from a suburban mom to a seasoned patent-holder, could pitch an idea for an invention - their bare minimum is a one-sentence description, not a technical write-up or elevator pitch. Anyone, anywhere, can "influence" the inventions by deciding details on it or voting for the highest-quality ideas. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: There are no limitations or criteria preventing anyone from contributing, in an inventor or influencer role. In practice, inventors seem to be younger people who have encountered a problem repeatedly. There is no data released on influencers. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The company pays inventors - the people who pitch the original idea - 4.2% of the revenue of the product, assuming the product is manufactured and sold. It is easier to be an influencer; you can weigh in on design and price details of a product that is guaranteed to be rolled out, though of course your contribution is much less. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Interestingly, at Quirky the crowd regulates itself via a voting system for ideas. However, there is involvement from experts (retailers, manufacturers, marketers) when, each Thursday night, the company meets and picks the next idea to manufacture. People weigh in on design concerns, and at the end of the night, the physical crowd (mixed between experts and non-experts) votes on whether or not they will manufacture something. If more than half of the crowd votes yes, the founder has committed to moving it to production. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Typically, the government would protect the interests of investors by providing some type of intellectual property right. Quirky does not give credit to investors, but rather purchases the rights to an idea if they decide to use it, passing a share of the revenue along to the investor. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: N/A
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Contributions are aggregated via a simple majority. The most votes for non-quantitative options and the simple mean for quantitative options determine design specifications and prices, even product names. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Quirky has nearly one million contributors, and has released 344 products since 2009.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Quirky has projected $100 million in earnings in 2014.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: It would likely work better the larger the crowd becomes. There would be more ideas proposed, and, assuming patient and thorough voters, the best would rise to the top, where a larger crowd would ensure better price points, names, and color choices. The quality would improve and Quirky would likely benefit from an even larger customer base. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service does not seem to be advertised on any external sites, only on the shopping portal itself. If you decide to "invent," you are brought to a form to describe your idea. Once that is completed, "influencers" can vote to indicate their favorite design ideas. Then the Quirky team decides whether or not they will produce it, at which point influencers can vote for design specifications, name, prices, etc. <p>Both inventors and influencers receive a fraction of the revenue if Quirky decides to produce it. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I want to work for them! In a real, employee-type-way, not as an influencer. Being an inventor would be cool too. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: According to an anonymous forum site, they promise to pay inventors 40%, but in reality only pay 4.2% of revenue. This is probably because they also compensate influencers. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company sells the devices after they are pitched, assessed, priced, and designed by the crowd. Quirky manufactures the devices, sometimes for sale on their website, sometimes in partnership with retail giants like Home Depot.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No, although I've used its service before.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Netflix is a media business, mainly focused on renting DVDs and unlimitedly streaming movies and TV shows.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.netflix.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 1997
  who_were_the_founders: Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Supposedly, Hastings came up with the idea for Netflix when he was charged $40 for late fees on a very late copy of Apollo 13. <p>(**ppt&#58; Hastings got charged $40 for late fees - wasn't happy **)
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Internet video streaming and disc rental.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: They started with only an online disc rental service, which was pay per rental. After this, they added a subscription based service. From there, they drop the pay per rental and progressed to the internet streaming later on.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The company Quickflix is an Australian company of similar design, focusing on online movie rentals and their distribution<p>The company GameFly, which was modeled after Netflix, is similar except for online video games instead of movies.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: People of all ages, including families and students will use this in lieu of going to their local rental movie place (which are all but nonexistent anymore). I've personally used this service to catch up on old TV series and watch movies that I either haven't seen before, or wanted to watch on a whim, opposed to planning a whole movie night and segmenting time to go and pick up a movie from BlockBuster or a RedBox. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The contributers of the service are the same people who purchase subscriptions to Netflix and watch the movies and TV shows
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: They are incentived not explicitly, but rather implicity by the results of the contributions. People's recommendations help rank what movies they enjoy, and help Netflix give suggestions for movies or shows they would probably like to see.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Controversially, they have purchased "highways" of bandwidth, partnering with certain internet providers, so that their streaming service won't be interrupted or hampered.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: They are aggragated according to an algorithm. This algorithm has changed a lot in recent years, and Netflix even offered a $1,000,000 prize to a person/team who could up with an algorithm that beats their current one by 10% for guessing what TV shows and movies people would watch.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: On the order of 50 million users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: The operating income is $228 million where the total assets are $5.4 billion.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Netflix is primarily an English site, showing English movies, with the option of other languages subtitles as well as some small selection of foreign movies. Therefore, to scale up by 10 times, to ~500 million users, would hit the limit of English speakers of the world (currently ~430 million), so they would be limited by that factor. Their incentive scheme is already scaled to such a high number, that I don't believe it needs scaling, although the quality and aggregation model might need to adapt to more worldwide users, especially where people come from different cultures, even if speaking English, and consider how it may affect their contributions.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised heavily through internet ads, commercial TV ads, as well as word of mouth. Contributors contribute by rating a movie or show on a 5 star system through the site, prompted after they watch it. Users in the end get an aggregation from other users of the popularity of certain movies and how that might relate to their preferences. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: They've had some contoversies about throttling of DvDs, perhaps "unfairly" buying out of the highway lanes of the internet in order to provide their service quickly, as well as some social media support that they later dropped.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They generate revenue through the subscriptions of their customers.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I am an active contributor to the site.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Stack Overflow is a crowdsourced question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.stackoverflow.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Stack Overflow was created as a crowdsourced alternative to earlier Q&A sites like Experts Exchange. Interestingly enough, the name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, founder Atwood's popular programming blog. As the primary purpose of the site was to help programmers solve and help each other with mainly technical programming issues, the terms ‘stack' and ‘overflow' can be put together to loosely mirror ‘memory overflow' in meaning!
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The main purpose of stack overflow is to provide a forum for the online programming community to get together and discuss technical aspects across a wide range of programming languages and structures in an interactive and open Q&A format. The site has users who post both queries and answers and moderators who monitor postings and bulletins.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Stack Overflow is used primarily by programmers working in nearly every kind of possible programming language or environment to troubleshoot problems, offer solutions to other problems in the community and to participate in finding answers in the field of computer science and programming. Each user first logs in with a free account and can then post queries that need answering and can provide working solutions and explanations to other ongoing query resolutions. Active members earn reputation points which make their answers more reputable.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users are the contributors.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: By answering questions and getting solutions voted up by other community members on the site, contributors are encouraged to use Stack Overflow and improve their online reputation and coding profile. Special badges and achievements on the site profile can be unlocked, which leads to a very highly viewed profile that can be linked or referred to on other sites on the internet.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: As the website is all about ‘finding answers' the quality of the answers is collectively assessed by the ‘crowd' of users actively participating in the community, through vote ups or vote downs and through reputation points. There are moderators who routinely run searches through threads to check for duplicated questions/old unanswered questions etc, but majority of quality control is user judged.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Yes, users earn reputation points for their Stack Overflow account profiles (which show up on each question posted or answered). This raises the repute of high point-earners, making their answers much more reliable than beginners. There are also special badges and achievements which can be unlocked and added to the profile.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Multiple users can provide answers to the same question/query. However, by the process of voting up the most relevant/accurate/efficient answer, the website crowdsources the process of ranking questions. All answers are shown by default, but higher voted up answers are shown first.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: In 2012 they had over 175,000 users, the global	site ranking is currently 49 and its 51 in the US.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Their revenue is not listed publicly because it is a privately held company.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think the incentive scheme would scale well, as long as Stack Overflow Careers could grow accordingly. With more users the quality would be even better, because there would be more feedback on the quality of the questions and answers. The only problem might be if there were not a balanced amount of questions and people answering questions.<p>
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: They don't delete repetitive posts, so there are a lot of keywords on the site, leading to it being at the top of search engine hits. Unanswered questions are listed under a tab on the homepage of the site, making it easy for people to answer questions. Contributors and users are the same people, and they answer and ask questions for the goal of sharing information.<p>

  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: No
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held website
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Stack Overflow is a part of Stack Exchange which is an online package framework for a multitude of websites and they all generate revenue through ad listings on the website in strategic locations on the page - such as between questions and answers and next to question lists. In addition, Stack Overflow displays job positions and career options from external partner companies (mostly in the computer programming sector) which also add to the total revenue stream.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I contacted the office and the Press Contact.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: CrowdMed uses crowdsourcing to collaboratively solve even the world's most difficult medical cases quickly and accurately online. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.crowdmed.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2013
  who_were_the_founders: Jared Heyman, Jessica Greenwalt, and Leonardo Setyano
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: From the website&#58; "After nearly three frustrating years, Carly was desperate for answers. She was clearly suffering from a serious medical condition, but nearly two dozen doctors, countless medical tests and over $100,000 in medical bills still could not tell her what was wrong. Carly had once been a vibrant, healthy teenager, but now she could barely get out of bed. Her symptoms and the emotional stress were pushing her and her family to the breaking point.<p>Finally, after a rare opportunity to consult with a top-notch interdisciplinary team of medical experts from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Carly received an answer&#58; "Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency" (FXPOI) - a rare genetic mutation found in just one of every 15,000 people. Even more astounding, the treatment of Carly's condition involved a simple hormone patch, which effectively eliminated all of her symptoms in less than one month.<p>Prior to her diagnosis, Carly was starting to wonder whether her life was already over. Today, Carly is fully recovered, with a new family of her own, and she is actively achieving all of her personal and professional goals."<p>Carly's medical mystery took nearly three years, two dozen doctors, and more than $100,00 in medical bills to diagnose.Her case was eventually solved after she had a rare opportunity to meet with a large, interdisciplinary team of top-notch medical experts - who all collaborated and worked together, and remained focused on the case for as long as it took to reach a consensus-based diagnosis.Thus, her brother, Jared Heyman, was inspired to start CrowdMed.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: CrowdMed uses crowdsourcing and patented prediction market technology to diagnose rare conditions that doctors could easily miss, as well as offering “second opinions” to patients who may be unsure of the accuracy of their stated diagnosis. CrowdMed's patented technology uses the collective knowledge, intelligence, and unbiased opinions of thousands of “Medical Detectives” to present an accurate list of a patient's most probably diagnoses, sometimes in a matter of hours. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: This service doesn't really replace the practice of health specialists and online health forums, but it does help in finding solutions faster and easier. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.patientslikeme.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Rip Heminway did a lot of running, soccer, back-country skiing, and white water kayaking. However, he started losing mobility and getting chronic pain. He said that a specialist would give him a list of different htings they think it might be, but never any kind of concrete clarity around what the problem was. He ended up spending thousands of dollars on specialists, blood tests, lab results, and the like. When he got his report from CrowdMed, he got a whole series of diagnoses which gave him a great foundation to work from. CrowdMed provided him to find succinct information. He is now pain-free and fully functional.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: While most of the Medical Detectives are active in medicine, others might not be doctors but do have first-hand experience with specific medical conditions. CrowdMed has proven that many kinds of people can help solve medical mysteries - including researchers, students, and even former patients.<p>
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: CrowdMed uses a point-based system to track Medical Detective performance and reward our community appropriately. By maximizing their point earnings, Medical Detectives can improve their ranking and reputation, earn the recognition of their peers, and even earn cash compensation offered by patients. Most importantly, Medical Detectives help patients get their lives back, which provides a sense of personal satisfaction in itself. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: CrowdMed uses a patented prediction market algorithm to assign probabilities to each diagnostic or solution suggestion based upon our Medical Detectives' background and behavior. They look for the most probable solutions, not just the most popular ones.<p>CrowdMed has devoted several years to develop patented prediction market methods to filter out any "noise" from all the input, to produce a report that highlights the top diagnostic and solution suggestions from the highest ranked Medical Detectives, which have the most confidence within the community.<p>Medical Detectives assign points to indicate their confidence in the suggestions offered to your case - a key component to the success and accuracy of the service. The points system requires people to prove their confidence, rather than just assume they're correct.<p>
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: n/a
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Cases are active for 30 days unless extended by the patient. At the end of this period, patients are asked to review the results with their physician and select the best diagnostic and solution suggestions. Medical Detectives who contributed to these suggestions are awarded points, status, and even cash compensation from those patients offering it - but the greatest reward for most of our Medical Detectives is knowing they've helped people get their lives back.<p>“Detective Rating System”. This system assigns a score to each Medical Detective on a 1-10 scale, which is expressed as their DetectiveRating (e.g., DR6). Inspired by Google's PageRank system, our DetectiveRating system provides a variable opinion weighting and special privileges to those Medical Detectives who perform the best on our site. For example, only DR6's and above can assign points on diagnostic and solution suggestions on cases offering cash compensation, thus influencing their probability rankings. Note, a peer rating from a DR8 carries twice as much weight as one from a DR4.<p><p>
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Cases are active for 30 days. When a case is posted, Medical Detectives provide well-researched and evidence-based diagnostic suggestions for patients to confirm with their doctors by posting them to the case. At the end of this process, contributions are aggregated, and the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solution,along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Information not available. Called the office and they said they could not disclose information not on the website.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars:  In 2013 they received $1.1 million in seed funding.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If the company were to scale up to 10 or 100 times its current size, I think that its business model would still work. The current quality/aggregation model would work even for bigger sizes; however, there may possibly be a need to better categorize cases if the number of cases significantly increases in order to help Medical Detectives better find the cases they would most likely be familiar with. The reputation model of the Medical Detectives may also change to put more emphasis on the professional credentials of the Detectives in addition to their contribution to the site. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When a case is posted, Medical Detectives have the chance to provide input for the case. Medical Detectives may also use chat and discussion features to ask questions, request additional details, and discuss your case. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solutions, along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I think that this company has a great idea; I'm surprised that there are no other companies just like it. CrowdMed does a great job providing information to those who may not have access to it; however, the quality of the obtained information must be carefully assessed. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: At the moment there are no public controversies about the company. However, I feel like there could be controversies contributors could fake their credentials or provide misleading diagnoses. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: In terms of revenue, the company is currently charging a 10 percent commission on all cash rewards offered by patients for accurate diagnoses.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: FiveThirtyEight (538)
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://fivethirtyeight.com/<p>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/upshot-vox-fivethirtyeight-data-journalism-golden-age<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight<p>http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Tried the company's service - navigated though the website and read posted articles
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: FiveThiryEight is a poll aggregator and data analysis website and blog.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://fivethirtyeight.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: March 7, 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Nate Silver
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The website was launched and quickly gained prominence during the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. 538 (at the time consisting of only founder Nate Silver) was unique in its approach to predicting the outcomes of primary elections, using a model based mainly on demographic information and past results in other states, rather than polls, to predict outcomes. In many cases, this model was more accurate than the traditional poll-based model, garnering significant attention for the site throughout the election cycle and beyond.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The site produces statistical analysis and blog content covering a wide range of subject matter. Most prominently, the site produces statistically modeled predictions for upcoming elections using polls published by other outlets and various other data. Other content categories include Sports, Economics, Science, and Life. In a typical post, a data-driven approach is taken to providing insight into a particular topic. For example, one of today's main features is "America's Best Burrito", the last of a series of articles in which burrito shops from across the country (chosen based on Yelp data and "expert" opinions) have been scored using a prescribed methodology and a winner picked using a bracket-style competition. The feature focuses not only on burritos, but also on the reliability and usefulness of crowdsourced data found on sites like Yelp.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: As a poll aggregator, 538 is similar to many services before it, including such companies as Real Clear Politics and the Princeton Election Consortium. Unlike these sites, 538 offers significant non-political content on top of its poll aggregation services.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The Upshot<p>Vox<p>First Look Media
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The service is meant for readers of all backgrounds who are seeking interesting and new insights into topics with which they are already familiar. The website is well designed, visually appealing, and easy to use. Much of the content is interactive, with infographics and charts which are click-able and customizable.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Contributors to 538 are its data sources and the site's staff of writers and data analysts. Data sources include various polls published by other (sometimes competing) publications. 538 has received criticism for its lack of transparency about the way in which its gathered polling data is used in its models.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: FiveThirtyEight collects data by paying for it or gathering it from its publication on other sites. Thus, not all "contributors" to 538 necessarily do so willingly or knowingly.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: When polling, FiveThirtyEight uses large sampling pools and then applies several mathematical adjustments to these sampling pools to ensure the accuracy of its numbers.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: N/A
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: N/A
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: FiveThirtyEight accumulates polling data from several polls and then calculates an adjusted score based on these parameters (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pollster-ratings-v40-methodology/).
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Scaling 538 to 10 or 100 times its size would not largely affect the business model. The company would require more employees to run statistical analyses, but because 538 compiles data rather than collects it, the business model would not be as other companies' who depend on data collection.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: FiveThirtyEight uses other polls and does not directly crowdsource.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 538 was not a perfect match for many of these questions because it uses data differently than many other consumer data-dependent companies. 538 does not directly generate revenue from its customers and thus cares less about their spending behavior. Obviously, 538 wants to increase its number of readers, but 538 has access to less consumer data because there are no transactions between 538 and its customers.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: 538 and Nate Silver came under fire for its lack of transparency regarding how it ranks its pollsters. This led Silver to publishing an article detailing its methods for adjusting the rankings of its pollsters.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: FiveThirtyEight generates revenue by selling advertisements on its webpage. In the past, revenue was also generated by "licensing" content to be published elsewhere, notable by the New York Times from 2010 to 2013.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kiva is a not-for-profit microfinance platform that allows moneylenders around the world to empower entrepreneurs with just $25
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.kiva.org
  when_was_the_company_started: October 2005
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Flannery and Jessica Jackley
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Kiva was started by the couple Jessica Jackley and Matt Flannery. A lecture by Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, was a call to tap into the power of micro lending. They spearheaded Kiva with entrepreneurs in Kenya, who struggled to get past the lack-of-captial hump. The company's name means 'unity' in Swahili.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: They provide a service to local entrepreneurs, field partners, and individual lenders. Their 'social service' is provide entrepreneurs with a platform to accumulate funding. Kiva field partners--who can be microfinance institutions, nonprofits, schools, and social businesses--upload information about entrepreneurs onto Kiva. The field partners handle the disbursement of the funds raised on Kiva to the entrepreneur, who will pay them back with interest in time. Individual lenders are provided a simple, nearly net-zero way to support social projects--the money they contribute to entrepreneurs is paid back as Kiva credit to give to a new loan.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Kiva is an revolutionary add-on to typical microfinancing efforts. Not only does it organize and validate the loans disbursed by microfinance institutions, Kiva enables other organizations to become established microfinancers. This includes schools, non profits, and social enterprises, who all interface with a wealth of worthy entrepreneurs.<p>It 'recycles' loan money by crowdsourcing. Small donations by lenders accumulate into loans that the field partners can disburse. The entrepreneur still gets their funding, the field partner collects the same interest on the loan as usual, but the lender gets paid back in credit and the money can be reused more efficiently.<p>
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: United Prosperity (http://www.unitedprosperity.org/) - Kiva equivalent<p>Zidisha (https://www.zidisha.org/) - alternative to Kiva that connects lenders to borrowers directly, without using loan officers<p>Grameen Foundation (http://www.grameenfoundation.org/), Accion (http://www.accion.org/) - provides financial services to the poor<p>GlobalGiving (http://www.globalgiving.org/) - supports social entrepreneurs and non-profits<p>Vittana (http://www.vittana.org/) - microfinancing student loans 
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: As a lender (an average person browsing the internet to do social good), you 1)Sign up as a kiva lender, 2)Browse borrower profiles and choose someone to lend to 3)Get paid back in Kiva credit and start again @ #2
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Based on a January 31, 2013, survey by Kiva (“Kiva Lender Demographics for Kiva Field Partners”), Kiva lenders are 2/3 female and 1/3 male. About 67% of lenders are 35 or older, while about 20% of lenders are 25 - 34 years old. Over 60% of Kiva lenders have a college degree. Approximately 60% of Kiva lenders live in the United States. The rankings by total amount lent per country are as follows&#58; United States (49.96%), Western Europe (14.33%), Canada (6.64%), Australia (3.05%), Asia Pacific (1.71%), Middle East / North Africa (0.34%), Central America / Caribbean (0.22%), South America (0.13%), Central and South Asia (0.09%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (0.05%). 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: As stated in the above report, these are the most common motivations for people who lend on Kiva&#58;<p>● A method of helping other people. <p>● A way to share their personal good fortune with others. <p>● A way to help an individual improve their social and economic standing. <p>● A window to the world, allowing a lender to become exposed to different people and cultures. <p>● A way to connect with, or give back to, a region where they have traveled or lived. <p>● A way for a lender to help an individual who shares common characteristics to themselves (age, gender, family size/structure, profession, etc.). <p>Additionally, Kiva often releases timed incentives such as, “Donate in the next two days and have your donation matched,” to further encourage lending activity.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: They review profiles of potential borrowers before posting them as eligible to receive a loan. This is a good filtration system to keep the projects listed social impact-guaranteed.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Many countries regulate the microfinance industry to prevent fraud, protect consumers, and stabilize financial markets. Regulations change from country to country; for example, the Reserve Bank of India requires that loans made to non-government microfinance institutions have a minimum term of 3 years. Kiva has found ways to work within these regulations by holding on to repaid loans for 3 years before sending repayments back to lenders. Other countries, such as Ecuador, impose interest rate caps and/or extra taxes on internationally-funded microfinance organizations; these regulations directly impact Kiva's field partners, who must find ways to comply. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: They allow individual lenders to join Lending Teams, which give towards different loans as a group. Kiva puts up a Leaderboard for Lending Teams, which displays top giver and how much they've giving total. Currently, I see Kiva Christians and Carnegie Mellon on the Leaderboard.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: An international network of 274 (as of September 8, 2014) microfinance organizations screens borrowers, posts loan requests to Kiva, disburses loans to borrowers, and collects repayments from borrowers. When a lender makes a loan, Kiva delivers the funds to the local Field Partner, who then takes charge of loan administration.<p>
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: As of September 8, 2014, there are 1,219,715 active lenders on Kiva who have funded 1,409,460 borrowers. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: As of September 8, 2014, there has been $607,594,600 made in loans.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Yes, The incentive--your money is paid back to you to give again--will always be a component of the Kiva model, even at a huge scale. The quality of the user experience could go down, if  it becomes impossibly hard to search for a great loan and some entrepreneurs never receive funds. (The amount of lender) * (the average amount of money they give) must always be nearly equal to the total amount of money that all loans on Kiva are asking for.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Kiva advertises 4 simple steps for lenders&#58; 1)choose a borrower 2)make a loan 3)get repaid 4)repeat! The contributors give in step #2 via a secure transaction through PayPal. The users, the field partners, gain the ability to facilitate a loan without putting up all the capital for it. They crowdfund the money through Kiva for their entrepreneur and get paid back by the entrepreneur with the same amount of interest.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I think they're wonderful. I'm very curious who their first supporters were, because they have a web interface that's top of the line and obviously required some serious initial investments. There have been a few corrupt field partners, and the model they present isn't entirely honest (they distribute funds to the borrower before publicly posting their profile), but they get the job of microfinancing done with more efficiency and less uncertainty than has traditionally been seen. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Kiva, like many microfinance and charitable organizations, has had its share of transparency problems. A post on NextBillion.net dated February 10, 2014, entitled “The Kiva Fairytale” alleged that Kiva had “zero overall impact (on a good day).” The author attacked Kiva's claims of being a peer-to-peer lending service (as in reality, loans backstop pre-existing loans at microfinance institutions), cast doubts on the integrity of its partner banks, and accused Kiva of overall “deliberate deception.” Kiva's co-founder and CEO subsequently responded to these allegations. Additionally, Kiva launched Kiva Zip in 2011, which functions as a direct peer-to-peer microloan service between the United States and Kenya. Premal Shah, Kiva's president, calls this service “the future of Kiva.”<p>As a side note, a month-long study of Kiva donor activities published March 2012 found that lenders tend to strongly favor female borrowers and those they considered “more attractive, lighter-skinned, and less obese.” 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kiva is entirely dependent upon donations. For every loan they make, lenders are encouraged to donate an additional few dollars directly to Kiva&#58; “The majority of Kiva donations are provided by our lenders, who ‘tip' us on top of the loans they make to borrowers. … A large majority of the rest of our donation income is provided by foundations, who encourage us to create innovative programs to serve the poor more effectively (e.g. Google.org funding of Kiva Labs).”

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Woot (shirt.woot specifically)
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: shirt.woot.com,<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot#Bibliography,<p>http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y10/m07/i01/s01,<p>http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/woot,<p>http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/woot-amazon/
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I have bought a couple shirts from shirt.woot, and I can vouch for the quality, ease of purchase, and speed of delivery.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Shirt.woot, a sub-site of the company woot (with the tagline “One day, one deal”), holds a weekly contest for users to submit t-shirt designs, where other users vote on the designs they like best, and the winner goes on sale for a discounted price.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: shirt.woot.com
  when_was_the_company_started: Woot was founded on July 12, 2004, but shirt.woot was started until July 2007
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Rutledge
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Woot began in 2004, but quickly branched into it's first sub-site wine.woot, which offers daily deals on wine that they will ship to your home.  Then came shirt.woot, which utilized the user voting schema.  After branching off into even more sub-sites (kids.woot, deals.woot, computers.woot, tools.woot, electronics.woot, etc.) woot was acquired in 2010 by Amazon for an estimated $110,000,000.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It is an Internet retailer.  It provides a community of artists and consumers, and allows amateur artists to release works to be reviewed by the community.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Threadless
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: In my personal experience, I subscribe to the email listserv, which sends out the one deal per day.  If I like the design, then I have a limited time to buy the shirt before it either goes up in price, or runs out of stock.<p>Another use one might have would be that of an amateur artist.  As an artist, you can submit designs for free.  Have them be reviewed and commented on by peers in the community.  And if you win, you can garnish $1000 plus $2 per shirt sold after the first day.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Amateur artists submit designs for the weekly derby, and professional artists submit designs to shirt.woot's staff picks.  T-shirt buyers and artists vote on designs to decide what eventually gets printed and sold on the site.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Artists are motivated by the love of art, $1,000 for a top 3 position along with $2 for every unit sold after the first day.  Users are incentivized by voting for shirts that they would like to see win, printed, and delivered to their door for a cheap price.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: They have individuals vote on which t-shirts they want -- so the ones sold are the ones most demanded by the consumers. <p>There are also staff picks where shirt.woot employees select designs to be printed outside of the derby.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: The winners, whose shirts are sold at a discount, are determined via votes. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: The weekly derby allows artists to submit designs for a 1 week period during which other artists and users will vote on designs.  At the end of the week three designs are called the winners, and receive $1,000 + $2 per shirt sold after the first day.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: This information is not readily available. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: This information is not readily available, as it's parent company Woot was bought by Amazon in 2010 for 110 million. However, it's parent company, Woot, had a $164 million dollars in revenue in 2008. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: The incentive scheme would scale well because you could raise the amount paid to artists to attract better quality artists. The quality/aggregation model would also be ok because the shirts are picked by users and the staff -- so more users would automatically mean a more robust aggregation model. If the service were to scale to 100 times size in terms of orders, fast distribution of the t-shirts to users might be an issue without a large enough staff to handle orders, generate t-shirts, and monitor the supply chain. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Attract artists to submit designs to the curated store or weekly derby through the financial incentives described above. Contributors can either submit their t-shirt designs or vote on the designs they like best. If a designer is in the top 3 in voting, he will get paid $1000 the first day and $2 for every shirt sold the day after. The voters will get to purchase the t-shirts that won as well. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: On select days woot will forgoe the "One day, one deal" mantra for a woot-off where deals are set with a fixed volume, and when all units are gone, another deal is put up within minutes.  The users are shown a progress bar, but no specifics on the amount of units left in stock.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: N/A
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: It garners profit from the t-shirts sold.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Waze is a mobile GPS application that provides turn-by-turn directions and attempts to enhance the accuracy of travel times by using user-submitted road information to display for traffic delays and other real-time incidents. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.waze.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Uri Levine, Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not particularly, but according to the About page on Waze's website, the idea for the company came from Ehud Shabtai because he was poor at navigating his way to places, and when given a GPS system, he had ideas about how to improve it. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: GPS and turn-by-turn directions
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It enhances the accuracy of estimating travel times and traffic information, and other road information (such as speed traps, construction, etc.)
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Google Maps<p>Apple Maps<p>TomTom<p>Garmin<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The service can really be used by anyone who is trying to navigate from one place to another, and is not sure how to get there, or what the best route is. I have used Waze in the past and have found it to be great, with the traffic data being accurate and the interfacing being nice and very easy to use.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone can contribute to the services, and usually the users themselves are the contributors
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Waze incentivizes contributors by having a social, game-like feature, where users earn points whenever they contribute road information, and as they accumulate points, their ranking in the Waze community increases. However, there does not seem to be a reward for accumulating points, besides validating your contributions to Waze.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Waze relies on the users to ensure the quality of the service – if road or traffic information is incorrect, Waze hopes that users will correct this within the app. For example, Wazers can add the presence of a speed trap on a road, but if a user finds that this speed trap is no longer there, Waze asks the user to update this information in the app. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: N/A
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Waze's point system serves as the reputation system for the app. The more you contribute, the more points you get, and higher your rank within the Waze community. The point system is quite robust, and the method by which points are assigned can be found here https://wiki.waze.com/wiki/Your_Rank_and_Points#The_Table_of_Points<p>
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Waze has very complicated algorithms to aggregate the contributions, part of which depends on the points that the contributor has.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: According to Yahoo, there were nearly 50 million Waze users as of June 2013.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Waze was bought by Google for $1.1 billion but hardly generates revenues. They're revenue is not publicized, but it is known that it is less than $71 million. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I believe that for Waze, the more users the better. More users means more contributors, and more contributors means more accurate information on Waze in terms of traffic and road information. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The contributors contribute by simply driving on the road with the Waze app open. If they run into traffic or notice anything noteworthy on the road (construction, police, an accident, etc.) they can update the map with this information in a hands-free method. This gives the users a real-time map of their surroundings, which ideally has the most accurate traffic and road information available. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: N/A
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: No
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Waze has a location based advertising system that they launched in October 2012, which provided a source of revenue. There are also sources that say that they sell traffic data to companies such as Apple, which is trying to improve its Maps application.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: 99designs crowdsources graphic design.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://99designs.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Mickiewicz, Mark Harbottle
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Matt Mickiewicz started SitePoint Solutions, a content and community website for designers and developers, at age 14. After the site's users started having informal design contests, Mickiewicz decided to create 99designs to separate a marketplace for crowdsourced graphic design.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Crowdsourced graphic design, primarily cheap logo and branding designs for small businesses, start-ups, and non-profits.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces the informal design contests hosted on Mickiewicz's first company.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Many small businesses, startups, and non-profit organizations use this service. An organization answers questions in an online brief, chooses a type of design package, and launches a contest. Designers then submit their designs, to which the company can give feedback. After a week, the company picks the winner, signs the copyright agreement, and the winning designer is paid.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The contributors are graphic designers who submit work to design competitions.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Winning the design competition means that the designer has won the competition holder's business (and is thus compensated for their work). 99designs plays on graphic designers' need for portfolio work, along with the prize of a significant amount of money, in order to motivate participants. Many of the graphic designers are entry-level designers.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company receives a large number of potential designers from its huge graphic designer contributor base. From the submitted designs, the company hosting the contest has the ability to provide feedback to ensure they're getting the design more geared towards their vision.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: The more competitions a designer wins, the more opportunities they'll be selected for.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Designers find contests, to which they submit their design to. The contest host can sift through these designs.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 331,153 contests (not necessarily same as number of users)
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $149 - $2,500
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think its business model would still work well, assuming that the ratio of users to contributors remains the same / is higher. It could be possible the company would need to up its pricing packages, though I'm not sure. There are a huge number of businesses, start-ups, and non-profit organizations, and a great number of graphic designers trying to break into the business -- both who would be comfortable with using 99designs' services for the current pricing plans.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: 99designs markets easy "design you'll love", allowing users to pick a type of design plan, the quality of the plan (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), with the assurance that the company will get a great design after a week. The plan quality relates to the number of designs a user receives and is allowed to provide feedback on. Graphic designers search for jobs best suited to their talents and post designs to the contest. Users get their chosen design at the end of the week, for the rate they initially agreed on.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Yes -- 99designs has been criticized by graphic designers, who argue that it devalues the work of a designer. However, it's said this criticism comes from "middle-level designers" -- those who haven't just started out, but haven't broken into the top range of designers yet. Presumably, beginning-level graphic designers find 99designs great for breaking into the businesses, and top-level designers are not threatened by the business (as they've already secured their desired clientele/career).
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Users are charged a fee for posting a contest on their site.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Threadless sells t-shirts featuring the best designs submitted by artists and voted on by an active community.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.threadless.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2000
  who_were_the_founders: Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: It was founded with only $1000 and was originally a simple community of artists.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Threadless provides both an online community and e-commerce platform.<p>The online community allows artists to submit t-shirt designs and for other artists and fans to rate those designs (and indicate whether they would purchase them).<p>The e-commerce platform then takes the highest rated t-shirts every week, pays the artists for the designs, and then sells t-shirts with those designs.<p>
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It is like a traditional online t-shirt retailer but crowsources the designs and maintains a highly active and invovled community.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Design By Humans (www.designbyhumans.com) is the only other one with significant traction.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Digital artists and graphic designers, people interested in being part of a community, and people who want to buy creative t-shirts.<p>I once submitted a design a couple years ago but it fared poorly. I also voted for a t-shirt that succeeded and ended up buying it (I'll try and wear it to class one of these days).
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Artists submit designs; 200,000 have done so to date,<p>Community members rate the designs and help the Threadless staff decide which ones to print; there are about 2.4 million of them.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Artists make money when their designs are printed.<p>Community members are rewarded by the feeling that they are empowered to choose which designs get printed. Threadless also hires community managers to organize real-life meet-ups and keep members engaged.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company's internal staff reviews the highest rated designs to make sure they are appropriate and of sufficient quality.

  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards:

  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: There votes are averaged to provide an aggregated score for each design.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 2.4 million users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $30 million
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: At 24 or 240 million users, the community would be significantly tougher to manage. Fake voting is already a problem but would become a much tougher problem to deal with after that scale. To ensure quality, raters could perhaps have "karma" points (based off of Reddit) or something similar that would assign a higher weight to their ratings given good behavior in the past.<p>Given that level of poularity, the company would have to also give its artists more money for each design to better motivate them,
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Threadless advertises through banner ads all over the internet and SEM (I've seen a lot of advertisements personally in the last few years).<p>Contributors are either artists who then submit designs to the site. Communtiy members browse the designs and then rate and comment on them, indicating whether the shirt is something they would buy. Every week, the Threadless staff choose the 10 best designs and release them for sale, at which point anyone on the internet can purchase the t-shirts.<p>
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: There was a small controversy about brick and mortat retailer Hot Topic ripping off Threadless t-shirt designs but there was no uproar that was significant enough to incite large attention from the community or legal action from Threadless.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Used the company's service.<p>Haven't conducted an interview, but will interview a "Postmate" this week.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Postmates enables users to order from any restaurant or store by crowdsourcing people to make deliveries within an hour.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://postmates.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2011
  who_were_the_founders: Sam Street, Sean Plaice, and Bastian Lehmann
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not one that we can seem to find. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company provides an on-demand delivery service with a guaranteed delivery time under one hour, in which the user's "postmate" can pick up a list of items from any restaurant or store for a delivery fee under $10 (depending on location). It's essentially like having a personal assistant for an hour who can go to any store and pick up items for you. As the Postmates website states&#58; "If it's an item in a store or restaurant in your city, we can deliver it. Get pizza from Little Star, donuts from Bob's Donuts, a new coat from Nordstrom, a picture frame from Crate & Barrel, you name it."
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: In a sense, Postmates updates Uber's delivery and pick-up service--Uber allows users to deliver an item to another location, or pick-up an item, but the Uber driver is not authorized to make a purchase on behalf of the user. Postmates are authorized to pay for your order, and you are charged upon delivery.<p>Additionally, Postmates is similar to Instacart. Instacart allows users to order groceries, and delivers them within one day (depending on the time of day in which the order was placed). On the other hand, Postmates has a shorter delivery time and has a larger selection of items.<p>Seamless and GrubHub allow users to order food from select restaurants, but Postmates allows users to order food from anywhere.<p>Moreover, whereas it may take a few days to order a clothing item online, users can order Postmates to go to an outlet that might sell that item and pick it up at the store so that the user can have it within an hour. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Uber<p>Instacart<p>Seamless<p>GrubHub<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Many people order food online through services such as Seamless or GrubHub, but it's frustrating when the restaurant from which you want to order is not on either website, or doesn't offer delivery at all. With Postmates, a user can order from any restaurant, and the Postmate will pick up the order and deliver it. Thus, Postmates attracts those who order in food, as well as people who may be busy and could use someone to run an errand or two for them, such as picking up their dry cleaning, or getting a last minute birthday present for a friend.<p>I've used this service many times before, either to pick up groceries or to order food from restaurants that don't deliver (Chipotle or Sweet Green for example), and it's been a pleasant experience every time. The app allows the user to track exactly where the Postmate is, which is great, since we've all had the experience of ordering food, and then calling the restaurant extremely frustrated at the fact that the food hasn't come in over an hour and the delivery guy has already left the restaurant. With Postmates, you know exactly where your delivery is, and if it is delivered in over an hour, Postmates will refund your purchase. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The couriers, or "Postmates" as they're referred to, come from all over. Some are parents or college students trying to make some extra money on the side, while others are people with delivery backgrounds such as GrubHub or Seamless delivery guys or FedEx drivers, Uber drivers, Lyft drivers, etc. According to the company website, "To be a Postmate you must take pride in delivering exceptional customer service. There are a few other basic requirements - you must be over 18; own a bike, car, truck, scooter or motorcycle; and have an upbeat and positive attitude." Postmates must also complete a background check, attend a 30-minute orientation, and attend an onboarding session before being accepted. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The Postmates website states that experienced Postmates make up to $20/hour on weekdays and $25/hour on weekends, and contributors are allowed to choose their own hours, making for an attractive job to make a little extra cash. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company runs a thorough background check on each of its Postmates, as well as making each Postmate attend an orientation, run a few test jobs, and have an in-person interview. Moreover, the customer service for the app is fantastic, and if the Postmate takes over an hour to make the delivery, Postmates will refund the purchase. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Only in the case of alcohol and cigarette deliveries. In these cases, the standards vary by state. For example, at the moment Postmates can deliver alcohol and cigarettes in New York, as long as the Postmate checks ID upon delivery, whereas in Philadelphia (where Postmates just recently launched within the past two months) Postmates cannot yet deliver alcohol or cigarettes. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: After each delivery, you can rate the Postmate as well as write a review about that Postmate. When placing an order, you see your Postmate's name, photo, and rating. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: N/A
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: As of April, 2014, Postmates were making an average of 10,000 deliveries per week. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Postmates hasn't disclosed their revenue. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If the company were to scale to 100 times its current size, it would need to depend on a much larger workforce of "postmates". For this reason, the customer review aggregation would become more important (all couriers we have encountered so far have had a 5 star rating). Additionally, Postmates currently has a culture in which the CEO himself meets with the Postmates, and social events are thrown each week. It may prove to be difficult to maintain this culture when the company scales, and so it may be beneficial for an academia system be set up in the various cities that is responsible for instilling the company's culture and requirement for "good attitude". By maintaining this culture, and ensuring that all Postmates interact, the company may be able to scale while still ensuring a high service quality.<p>Furthermore, the company currently generates revenue by taking a percentage of the delivery fee, as well as payments made by restaurants to be featured on the home screen. If the company scales, then restaurants would be willing to pay a much larger fee to be featured on the home screen. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: At the moment, the majority of Postmates' expansion has been due to word-of-mouth rather than formal advertising campaigns. The contributors contribute by being available during their own set hours to make deliveries for the users, either by bike, car, or truck. This app allows users to pay a small fee to have practically any item that they could buy in a store delivered quickly to their home, making their lives easier and saving time. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: So far, the only controversy that seems to have occurred is that the CEO, in response to an email from customer complaining about past deliveries, thought he was sending an email back to customer service saying "Someone also please tell her to fuck off" but accidentally sent it to the customer, who, in modern fashion, tweeted a screenshot of the email. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company hasn't disclosed its total revenue, but it generates revenue by taking a certain percentage of each delivery fee. It also has a smaller revenue stream coming from the "preferred" restaurants/stores that it features on the apps home screen.

  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/ushahidi/<p>http://www.ushahidi.com/<p>https://wiki.ushahidi.com<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi<p>http://www.no-straight-lines.com/blog/ushahidi-a-story-of-non-linear-innovation/<p>http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/2011/03/09/the-volunteers-behind-the-libya-crisis-map-a-true-story/<p>http://www.missionmode.com/blog/15-disaster-and-crisis-apps-for-iphone-and-ipad/<p>
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Downloaded the Android app, checked out some of the maps.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Ushahidi creates crowd-sourcing applications for social activism, which are most useful for crisis response and political monitoring in the third world.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.ushahidi.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Ory Okolloh, Erik Hersman, David Kobia, Juliana Rotich
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Yes, it was founded during the aftermath of the 2007-2008 Kenyan election crisis. Meaning "testimony" in Swahili, Ushahidi was originally built so that the people of Kenya could report the political violence occurring through the country. It later expanded to serve a wide range of communities and problems through similar techniques.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company aggregates information concerning political crises and natural disasters to inform the public and make reporting more accurate for the betterment of society.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Google Crisis Response provides similar services to people, with a seemingly larger focus on services which directly help individuals (making emergency plans and preparations, sending updates) rather than aggregating data for general use, although they do this also.<p>There are other apps which provide similar services, but these are often more specific apps for specific problems, and are better at disseminating information provided by experts rather than aggregating information from the general populace. (Also, Ushahidi receives their revenue from licensing their software, and these apps are no threat in this area).
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: This is very difficult, as Ushahidi provides a variety of services and provides information to the public, rather than provide a service per se. A typical example of how somebody might use it would be when a crisis occurs. Especially during the beginning of the crisis, it is difficult for the government, local authorities, or other organizations to gather information and direct the public. Ushahidi allows the people to report information from the scene more easily, so that a person can simply look at the maps and better make decisions about how to react / where to go during the emergency.<p>Ushahidi's improved maps in Haiti were mentioned in class as an example. Additionally, they have done similar things after snow emergencies in Europe, flooding in the Missouri River Basin, and during the political unrest in Libya. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The people are the common citizens in an area in crisis. Quite typically, they are being affected by the crisis, and would like assistance. They likely represent a large part of the population, as anybody can report to Ushahidi as long as they own a cell phone (one can report events via text message, internet is not needed). 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The contributors are often directly affected by the crisis, and would like to let others know what is happening. They are motivated by 1) the assistance they may receive by reporting their troubles and/or 2) the knowledge that they are helping their community/country.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Ideally, the contributors are hoping to receive help, and would want to the advice they report to be accurate, and there is no direct incentive to give false information, especially in non-political crises.<p>Still, those who administrate the maps or other services do have the power to moderate content.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Ushahidi aggregates contributions automatically without filtering by default, although those who organize a crowd-sourced map can moderate data. The ultimate goal of this crowd sourcing is to gather the information for human use, so their aggregation simply consists of collecting.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: The information gathered by Ushahidi can improve the lives of millions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: This is difficult to say as it is hard to give a price to information goods.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If this scaling indicates the number of employee, the company could not grow by such a factor given it's relatively limited revenue. Already, much of the work and a sizable portion of the revenue come from voluntary contributors.<p>If this means the size of contributions, then it could scale quite easily, as the data is easily aggregated with little filtering.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Presumably, the service spreads through word of mouth within the community and is encouraged by charitable/humane organizations. Users contribute via interactive maps (or via sms, email in the case of products other than Crowdmap). Their contribution can sometimes result in assistance being delivered to these people, and the available knowledge can often improve organized responses to the problem and shed light on the issue at hand.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: This organization was a little difficult to profile as a non-profit. As such, revenue is not the main concern and we cannot analyze this company in the same way, especially when it comes to market analysis, incentives to users, competitors, etc. It was a very interesting company to profile because of this fact. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Our research has failed to discover any.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: In addition to donations, the organization generates revenue by deploying its quality software for clients. Ushahidi emphasizes that it does not accept money from governments to maintain neutrality in political crises.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: On October 19th, 2012, Iceland held the world's first ever “crowdsourced constitutional convention” online via Facebook and Twitter. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://stjornarskrarfelagid.is/?page_id=2619
  when_was_the_company_started: 2011
  who_were_the_founders: 2011 Iceland Constitutional Council (25 members)
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story:      In 2008, a banking crisis resulted in the near-collapse of the Icelandic economy. The banks were heavily in debt due to the global recession and corruption among the political and banking elite. In addition, citizens were unhappy that many of the country's rich fishing and geothermal national resources were being increasingly owned by foreign interests. In 2009, the center-right government collapsed and was replaced by a government that appointed a council of 25 ordinary citizens to recommend constitutional reform to the Althing, the parliamentary body of Iceland. <p>	94% of the population of Iceland (estimated at 324,000) have access to internet, making it one of the most “online” countries in the world. The constitutional council decided to solicit suggestions for constitutional reform on Facebook and Twitter via a six-question survey. After using the answers to this survey to develop an initial draft, the council gradually iterated over twelve drafts of the new legislation and consistently communicated with ordinary citizens via Facebook and Twitter. Updates of each draft were posted on a public website. Naturally, the opportunity to influence legislation made the survey incredibly popular. By the end of the voting period, over half of Iceland's voting-eligible body had contributed in some way to the process. <p>
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The Constitutional Council was an assembly of 25 people responsible for writing Iceland's new Constitution. At the beginning of their process of writing, they held a national vote on six yes/no questions for the citizens to vote on. During their process of writing, they made all of their drafts available to the public and posted videos of their meetings. They actively encouraged comments and feedback and incorporated that into their future drafts.<p>In short, they provided the service of giving citizens a voice in the writing of their Constitution.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces the traditional way that Constitutions were written&#58; by a small group of intellectuals in an intentionally secretive and obscured manner.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Some regions of the United States have tried crowdsourcing policies. Seattle's budget director, Beth Goldberg, created an online game that used people to make decisions about the budget in an attempt to shave off unnecessary money to close a $30 million gap in funding. However, this was only an experiment to see if the administration's cuts would align with the public's cuts. No crowdsourced government document has been executed on the same scale as Iceland's.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The Constitutional Council posts a draft of the Constitution on Facebook and the public website, and a user can comment on it with feedback and suggestions.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone with an internet connection could comment on the constitution Facebook or Twitter. Because the constitution is written in Icelandic, it is a foregone conclusion that only Icelandic nationals or expats would contribute.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Obviously, the ability for an ordinary citizen to potentially influence legislation, especially after an economic crisis, was a powerful incentive to participate.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The Constitution wasn't /truly/ crowdsourced in the sense that the text that went into the Constitution did not for the most part come from “the crowd.” Instead, commenters' feedback was incorporated into the Constitutional Council's decisions as to what to include, exclude or change in their draft of the Constitution.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Obviously, the ability to influence legislature is normally heavily “regulated”. A parliament member's ideas for change are regulated by his/her voting rights and the voting of all other members of the parliamentary body. In this case, the Althing, Iceland's parliamentary body, was dissolved before it could pass or reject the final draft because of political reasons. Elections were coming up and the ruling party was wary about experimenting with government legislature on a national scale. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: For the initial poll of six yes/no questions, the results were simply aggregated by summing up the number of votes on each one. For the comments on the successive drafts of the constitution, members of the Constitutional Council would comb through all of the online comments and take them into consideration, and they would even regularly meet with the commenters.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 120,000 people
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Iceland 2012 GDP&#58; $13.66 Billion
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: In general, I would guess that likelihood of success of a crowdsourced Constitution is inversely correlated with size of the country. For one, with more people, each person feels that his/her voice accounts for a smaller portion of the overall voice going into the Constitution. This leads to increased bystander effect and a lower participation rate (which was low in Iceland's case to begin with). This would lower the legitimacy of the Constitution's claim to truly represent all citizens' interests. Additionally, even though a lower percentage of people would participate, there would still be a higher volume of comments and feedback for the Constitution writers to comb through. This could lead to commenters trying to make more sensationalist comments for the sake of gaining Likes, Retweets, and Upvotes, just so they can get noticed, rather than truly substantive suggestions that writers can pick out for their own merits. Plus, most other countries do not have as high of prevalence of the Internet as Iceland does, so many citizens would be forcibly excluded due to their technical incapability. It is also unclear how this situation would play out in the United States, which has a much more diverse electorate and has a very polarized political system at present.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service was advertised via traditional social media channels (Facebook/Twitter), local and international publications, and the public website that continuously issued new drafts and newsletter updates. Initially, citizens answered a six-question yes/no survey that served as the base of constitutional reform (one of the questions was&#58; “do you believe Iceland needs constitutional reform?”). Afterwards, the members of the council asked for direct written feedback on Facebook/Twitter, which they interacted with and incorporated into the drafts. In the end, citizens got an assurance that their suggestions were being taken into consideration.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: This experiment unfortunately didn't get passed by the government, but its high engagement and large comment base suggest that this crowd-governance model may be something that we see popping up in isolated situations in bigger countries and perhaps affecting larger legislation in smaller countries with high Internet access like Iceland. Japan and/or South Korea would be good frontiers to try this next.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: As referenced earlier, Iceland was a country that had just come out of a deep economic crisis in 2008. By 2012, the national economy was just starting to recover, so the logic behind running an experimental crowdsourcing platform for a new constitution was questionable. One of the most controversial aspects of the new suggested constitution was a provision in which all non-privately held natural resources, mainly fish and geothermal energy, would immediately fall under national property. Such radical nationalization methods may discourage future foreign investment in Iceland, adversely hurting their economy. Furthermore, this ruling would significantly hurt the business holdings of native Icelanders who owned large swaths of fishing coasts (known as “Sea barons”). Other minor issues revolve around declaring a national church and not giving equal weightage to votes regardless of location.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Government body
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Because we're discussing the use of crowdsourcing in a governmental context, this question seems non-applicable.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Coursera is a free online education platform that partners with universities to offer online classes to users.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.coursera.org/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Coursera was started by two Stanford University computer science professors who wanted to make quality higher education more accessible to the public. Andrew Ng taught a free machine learning course online and found over a 104,000 users from all over the world enrolled for the course. After only a month into teaching the machine learning course, Ng and colleague Daphne Koller left their tenured faculty jobs to start Coursera full time in April 2012 after raising $16 million from a round of venture funding.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Coursera provides massive open online courses (MOOCs), typically at the university level. These courses are designed and taught by professors at universities that Coursera has partnered with. The format of these courses are short videos, quizzes, and problem sets. In some courses, the pace is set by the user while other courses are regulated by the professor. There is also Q&A section for each course. Verification certificates are offered for some courses for pay. There are also specializations offered; these are essentially a series of courses on a related topic. Specialization certificates are awarded if verification certificates are earned in each of the courses.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Coursera is an improvement in the online education space and is unique in multiple regards compared to previous competitors. It was one of the first (although multiple similar companies, including edX and the Minerva Project, started at the same time) to offer quizzes and problem sets alongside educational videos. Khan Academy, which started in 2006, offers mostly educational videos, without the extra testing. Udacity, which began in January 2012, offers mainly courses in computer science. Coursera has a range of selections, including STEM as well as humanities courses.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Users of Coursera consist primarily of people who want to learn for their own interests and/or learn new skills that could make them more attractive to employers. Furthermore, Coursera's users wish to learn for free, or learn at only a small cost. Users sign up for an account and then sign up for courses based on their interest areas. Users can then proceed through the videos, quizzes, problem sets, and peer-reviewed assessments of problem sets either at their own pace or, for some courses, at the pace set by the instructor. Courses that are self-paced can be started at any time, but courses that are not can only be joined when sessions are scheduled. All the courses can be taken for free, and once the course is completed, a certification of completion is awarded. Some courses offer “verified certificates” upon completion, but this requires payment from the user. The “verified certificates” are certifications by Coursera and the university providing the course that the user has successfully completed the course; it requires verification of user identity to ensure the user and not someone else is doing the work. Successfully obtaining verified certificates in all of the courses in a specialization series allows the user to get a “specialization certificate.” Specialization series are a group of courses that allow the user to gain skills in a specific area, such as data science or modern music.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The people who contribute services are primarily professors at universities. Coursera has partnered with 100 global universities and 7 non-university partners so far.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The contributors of Coursera (aka the professors) are primarily motivated to participate by their own interest to contribute to the education platform. Many of the universities have their own education initiatives, like Penn's Open Learning program.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company partners with universities to provide courses so there is some inherent guarantee of quality of the content because of the high level at which the professors who teach the courses are employed. The full process is as follows. University staff work together to ensure the quality of the course description page before it is submitted to Coursera. Coursera then verifies the course description page and uploads it to their website. The instructor must provide a detailed description of the content and resources to be used at least two months in advance through a Course Development Agreement (CDA). The instructor, university staff, and Coursera all sign the CDA, holding them responsible for the class. A minimum amount of content needs to be uploaded a month before the class. Instructor and university staff are responsible for continued content monitoring during the course, and Coursera continues monitoring student discussions and technical issues. If Coursera notices any course issues on the student discussions, it relays it to the instructor. Coursera also develops a system of feedback for the students to offer comments on the course to instructors.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Education at the university level is regulated by the government to some extent. Both public and private universities have to comply with certain government regulations, although private universities typically have much more freedom. The intent of government regulation is to provide a higher quality of education and to improve access to education. With regards to education quality, it's difficult to say whether Coursera meets the government's standards because its goal and approach differs from those at traditional universities. However, being that most courses are taught by professors at well-respected universities, Coursera's courses are of high quality. With regard to accessibility, Coursera does meet government standards.
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: We did not find a reputation system on the Coursera website itself. However, we found a third party website called CourseTalk that allows users to view reviews for Coursera courses and review the courses themselves.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Each course is individually prepared by staff at a university (or one of the non-university partners), and the courses are aggregated through the Coursera website.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Coursera had 7 million registered users as of April 2014, and it had 22,232,448 enrollments as of January 2014.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Coursera had generated $1 million in revenue as of October 2013 (the most recent estimate we found).
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: We think that if Coursera were to scale up in size, it would still be able to successfully provide its services because it is primarily an internet-based service. However, we also believe that Coursera's current business model is not very profitable and that it will need to modify its business model if it wants to make more profit.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised as a free online educational platform that offers courses in a variety of subjects. The target audience is people who want to learn anything new; many are workers who want to freshen their skills as well as students who want to earn credit or learn something new for no credit. Contributors design courses and teach them through videos, as described in the question about how quality is regulated. The users are able to sign up for courses based on course descriptions for free or for a price if they want a verification certificate from Coursera and the university. After completion, a certificate or statement of completion is given for most courses. A more detailed explanation of verification certificates is in the question about how users use the service.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: Despite having generated relatively little revenue so far, Coursera continues to generate a large amount of venture funding. Their most recent round in November 2013 raised $20 million and the total venture capital so far totals $85 million. Their current business model seems to focus more on the mission statement of providing high-level education to the general public, but it does not seem ideal for generating a lot of revenue. They did not have any substantial revenue before adding the option for paying for certificates in January 2013.<p>There has also been some talk about providing MOOC users with the a job-finding service and charging commission. Coursera hasn't added a corporate section yet but may do so in the future.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: In January 2014, Coursera was notified by the U.S. government that providing the course experience is considered a service and that all services are restricted by export controls. As a result, Coursera temporarily suspended service in Iran, Sudan and Cuba. Coursera announced in September 2014 that it was able to reopen course access to residents of Sudan and Cuba, but access to Coursera courses by Iran residents remains limited.<p>More generally, there has been a fair amount of controversy about the effectiveness of MOOCs compared to traditional courses. Concerns have been raised about the fact that MOOCs teach through online videos without direct teacher or classmate interaction. There are doubts in the effectiveness of learning in the courses without the incentive of receiving credit for them. The issue of reliability is also a huge obstacle in providing university credit for MOOCs.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Coursera generates revenue by&#58;<p>Charging for its Verified Certificates.<p>Receiving revenue from an Amazon.com affiliates program when users of the website purchase books suggested by professors.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Foldit is a collabortation between the University of Washington's Center for Game Science and Dept. of Biochemistry, utilizing crowdsourcing in the form of a game in order to solve a real world problem involving protein geometry
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://fold.it/portal/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: David Baker and Seth Cooper
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founders were working with another automated solution to predict the natural structures of various proteins. This solution used protein structure prediction algorithms, which take lots of time and processing power to run. This program was later expanded to utilize the processing power of people's PCs around the world to run some of the algorithms. Users began to notice that they could see potential solutions to the structures, but since they couldn't interact with the algorithms they couldn't add their own insights into the program. Thus, FoldIt was born. The founders and their team turned the program into an interactive game that merges distributed computing and algorithmic predictions with the ability for people to tinker with the protein structures themselves.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It provides people with the opportunity to play an entertaining game while helping scientists solve challenging problems in biochemistry, such as how to target and eradicate diseases in the body.  
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces a purely algorithmic approach that was used to predict the native structures of various proteins, called Rosetta. This was then extended to utilize the processing power of user's personal computers, by developing a distributed computing program - Rosetta@home. However, users became frustrated that they could not interact with the program itself, eventually leading to an interactive version known as Foldit.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: There are a number of other human-based computation games including&#58;<p>ESP Game (labeling of images)<p>EteRNA (RNA folding)<p>Phylo (decoding code for genetic diseases)<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: An individual can sign up to donate a portion of his or her own computing power to assist with the project. In addition, they may participate actively in the game, which lets them play with the different configurations of proteins until they or the program think that they have found a potential solution. This solution is then analyzed by the program to predict how viable the structure is. If it is deemed a realistic possibility, the solution is sent to the experts at the University of Washington for further analysis. Since there are so many possible configurations for each protein, the possibilities are seemingly endless. The contributions from users help accelerate the prediction process.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone, probably mostly online gamers
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: They have created a game like interface for the program, which in turn provides users with intrinsic motivation to configure better guesses.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The best guesses from users are first analyzed by the algorithms that the FoldIt team has been working on since the program's inception. The ones that stand out in that pool are presented to the experts themselves, who continuously monitor the quality of the results that the algorithms churn out.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Players are rated based on frequency of success in guessing viable protein shapes.  Highest scoring configurations are then sent to experts for further analysis.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: All solutions are collected by a central system and rated by viability - the highest scoring entries are then sent to experts for further analysis.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 240,000 users as of 2012
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: It would still work relatively well because a lot of the analysis of how well players do is done algorithmically. However, if there were that many more people playing and contributing viable solutions, the scientists would probably have to expand their human team to keep up.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised as is; the website encourages contributors to "solve puzzles for science," and explains to them what the goal of the project is and why it matters. The users then play the game, and they get intrinsic gratification when the do well. When they do well, the project's scientists accrue data that will help them solve the puzzles involved in predicting the natural shapes of proteins.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: The project is regularly featured in documentaries about how crowd-souring and human computation are changing the future of science.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: None that we know of.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Research Project
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: It does not generate revenue, as it is a university sponsored research project.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I used the Flixster app, which acquired Rotten Tomatoes
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Rotten Tomatoes aggregates film reviews from critics and average viewers
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: August 12, 1998
  who_were_the_founders: Senh Duong, Patrick Lee, Stephen Wang
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Senh Duong, creative director at Design Reactor, developed the website as a side project, starting with aggregating reviews of all Jackie Chan movies. From its launch, the site was immediately successful, going viral linked with hit movies such as Star Wars&#58; Episode 1 and The Blair Witch Project. Patrick Lee and Stephen Wang tried to convince Duong to come back to Design Reactor, bringing Rotten Tomatoes with him, but eventually decided to instead join him at Rotten Tomatoes as its own entity, with their company, Design Reactor, as a sister company. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Aggregate movie and TV show reviews by users and critics; provides an aggregate rating. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Professional Movie and TV Show reviews (in newspapers and other publications).

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The user can either expressly go to the Rotten Tomatoes website to look up reviews and ratings or (more commonly), use Flixster to look up showtimes, etc., where the user will also be shown the movies rotten tomatoes score and reviews (from critics and users). As a user, I've only used it in the context of Flixster, but the ratings definitely carry serious weight, and if I see a movie with a low rating (below 60% will show a green "rotten tomato"), I will often check the reviews, and often not see the movie. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Users with Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster accounts (users can log into Rotten Tomatoes with with Facebook accounts as well). Users can also register as Critics, although they must be cleared as critics at well-standing publications, or something similar. Users' contributions are marked and sorted as either by regular users or by critics. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People are likely to contribute to have their opinions heard, especially if they felt very strongly (in one direction or the other) about a film or TV show. If a user's reviews get many likes, they can become critics and their reviews will carry more weight. There are also message boards on which users can discuss movies, TV shows, etc., so there is a social interaction incentive to communicate and contribute as well. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Rotten Tomatoes staff read critics' reviews and decide whether they are positive or negative. When a film or TV show has received enough reviews, the staff will also write a brief summary on the consensus for the movie that takes in all the reviews. A movie is "certified fresh" if it has more than 75% positive reviews and at least 40 reviews from Tomatometer critics (5 of which must be top critics). This ensures that they are providing an accurate and well-rounded review of the movie/show. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: (no regulation)
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: As above, top critics are cleared by the staff, and their reviews must also have a certain number of likes from other users. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: As above, the Rotten Tomatoes staff rates each review as positive or negative, and the final score is the percentage of positive reviews. On Flixster, the reviews are also sorted between users and critics. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 3,950,000 visitors / day; Alexa Rank&#58; 686
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $ 21,329,640 / year
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: No, because revenue is generated from advertising. Advertising hits viewers as well as contributors, but scaling up contributors does not necessarily increase total views (users + contributors), and further, while ad revenue is more closely linked to total views, it is not linearly correlated.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: A user goes onto the website or Flixster app, picks the movie she wants to review, and writes her review. The Rotten Tomatoes staff will determine if the review is positive or negative, which will affect the movies score. The review will also be listed when other users look at the movie's rating, either under critics or users, depending on who wrote the review. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: As with any site that is in open forum on the Internet, there is the danger of people commenting hurtful, dangerous, or threatening things. This happened to such an extreme around the release of the third Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, that the commenting section was temporarily shut down. This raised questions of monitoring content, as well as holding users more accountable for what they say online. It also touched on issues of conflict of interests as Rotten Tomatoes is a part of Flixster, which is owned by Warner Brothers, which also produced the Batman Trilogy (although Rotten Tomatoes said the decision to temporarily shut off the commenting capabilities was purely internal). 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Part of Flixster, which is owned by Warner Brothers, which is a subsidiary of Time Warner
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company's primary source of revenue, like many web companies, is online advertising
