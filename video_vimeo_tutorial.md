#Creating Videos
There are a variety of ways of making videos. Two of the easiest and most effective are 

1. Using a handheld camera to film a live presentation (think iPhone camera)
2. Using a screen recording software to record your screen and audio


##Option 1: Handheld camera
1. Take your favorite camera or more likely, favorite smartphone and record your presentation. 
2. Upload it to your laptop and you're all set


##Option 2: Screen recording
If you're on a Mac you can use Quicktime or Keynote to create a screen recording. 
###Quicktime
1. Open up QuickTime.
2. Go to File->New Screen Recording.
3. It'll give you the option to record the whole screen or just a part of the screen, and then start recording.
4. You can record your screen and audio at the same time, and voila, you have a presentation on video!
###Keynote

##Uploading to Vimeo
1. Sign up for a Vimeo account following the instructions on their [website](https://vimeo.com/).
2. You will receive and email with a link to verify your account, after which you can upload a video.
3. Navigate to the site, login and click the big blue upload button in the top right corner, you'll be prompted to upload your video. 
4. After choosing a file to upload, you'll end up at a page with all the details of your video. Format your title as the name of the project/company_homeworknumber, and make sure the privacy settings allow anyone to see the video.
5. After uploading the video vimeo will tell you that it's going through a technical process to format the video, and after that you should be all set!
