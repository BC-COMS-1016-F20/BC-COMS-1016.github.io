You are also welcome to profile a [relevant company](http://www.crowdsourcing.org/uploads/CrowdSourcing-Industry-Landscape-v09.jpg) that is not on this list (but please verify your choice beforehand with the instructor). 



This assignment has two deliverables:

1. Answering [a questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cEkW2h2xwVyKaXriKR7PqroPDjQZE34AKPoRP-lUV5Y/viewform?usp=send_form) about the company or project that you are researching (due 9/10/14).
2. A slideshow and video that you will use for an in-class presentation (due 9/17/14).

This assignment can be done individually or in pairs.

First, please sign up for a [company or project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOcI7BJUQGeG3Pb3oZPRqfTt2JYwRnjnTqImex9qsSQ/edit#gid=209977841).  If there’s a company that you’d like to research that isn’t on the list, you are welcome to ask the instructor or the TA to ask if it is OK.  Second, please choose a [presentation date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOcI7BJUQGeG3Pb3oZPRqfTt2JYwRnjnTqImex9qsSQ/edit#gid=0). Up to 3 presentations can go on the same day.

You should independently research the company, and then [fill in your answers about it in this questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cEkW2h2xwVyKaXriKR7PqroPDjQZE34AKPoRP-lUV5Y/viewform?usp=send_form).  Your short answers to these questions by <b>Wednesday, September 10</b>. 

You will record a short 5 to 7 minute video presentation about your company and present it in class on the date that you choose.  You must record the video.  For the in-class presentation, you can either play the recording and answer questions afterwards, or you can give a live presentation.  Your presentation should address the following questions:

- What incentives does it offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?
- Are there any controversies about the company?

Your presentation video is due <b>Wednesday, September 17</b>.

To turn in your video, please upload it to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). Then give us the link to your video in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bP_sk4aTMknox9XoZXVQRlSR0V7RD3MzmfeZPMLWSLU/viewform?usp=send_form). That is all. 

If you have managed to make it this far in life without having to sign up for accounts for things on the internet, here are more detailed instructions:

1. Go to [Vimeo]().
2. Create an account by clicking the enormous blue "JOIN" button. 
3. You will receive and email with a link to verify your account. You have to verify before you can upload videos.
4. Once you are signed in, click "Upload" at the top of the page.
5. Click the "Choose a Video to Upload" button and choose your video
6. Once it is uploading, you can change the privacy settings. If you are soon to be on the job market, be careful. You probably don't want potential employers to know how intelligently and elegantly you are able to analyze and present on the potential market value of technology companies, so maybe don't use your real name.
7. That's it! Fill in the title and tags and whathaveyou and use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bP_sk4aTMknox9XoZXVQRlSR0V7RD3MzmfeZPMLWSLU/viewform?usp=send_form) to tell us where to find it.
