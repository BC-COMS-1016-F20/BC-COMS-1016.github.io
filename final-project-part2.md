Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 2</span> 
=============================================================

This week's assignment counts as a deliverable toward your final project.  This assignment will be worth 10% of your final grade.  The goal of this assignment is to create a simple working prototype of your final project.  This will help to ensure that you are on top of all of the pieces of your project, and that you have a clear picture of how they interact.  This will hopefully allow you to divide the project into pieces that each member of your group can work on independently. 

###Step 1: Create a github repository 

You will use github to as a version share code across your group.
While you're at it, why don't you pick up a "CrowdFlower backpack."

###Step 2: Work out the different pieces of your project

* Flow diagram.
* Screen shots / mockups of all interfaces that the crowd will see or that the end-users will see.


###Step 3: Gather any inputs

If your project needs inputs like Tweets about HPV, pictures of celebrities wearing stylings threads, or psycholinguistic stimuli, then spend time gathering a set of these inputs.  

Show us examples. 

###Step 4: Create data to simulates the crowd's input.

Eventually you'll be gathering real data from the crowd.  Before that happens you should create fake data that you can use as input for the initial implementation of your modules.   Create a data specification README file that describes the format.  Ideally the format will be reusable when you get real data from your workers.  That way you only have to change your input files, and your algorithms can operate as they did before.

###Step 5: Quality control module

Create a simple, working version of your quality control module.  This can be a simple majority vote, a 2nd pass HIT, or whatever.  You should also describe what you'll need to do to improve it for the final version of your project.

###Step 6: Aggregation module

Create a simple, working version of your aggregation module.  This version can operate on your simulated data.  Say what additional work is needed for the final version of your project. 


###Step 7: Answer another questionnaire 

What the hell is up with all of these questionnaire?  [Blame Francis Galton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton#The_questionnaire).  He also invented Vimeo.

You will be asked to answer to provide the following information:

* Team members.
* Name for the project.  
* One sentence description of the project.
* What type of project is it? (Human computation algorithm, social science experiment with the crowd, a tool for crowdsourcing, a business idea that uses crowdsourcing)
* Who will be the members of your crowd? 
* How will you incentivize them to participate?
* What will they provide, and what sort of skills do they need?
* How will you ensure the quality of the crowd provides? 
* How will you aggregate the results from the crowd?
* Describe each of the steps involved in your process.  What parts will be done by the crowd, and what parts will be done automatically. 
* How will you evaluate if your project is successful? 

You should submit your answers to the question on [the simple prototype questionnaire](XXX). 

Step 8: Turnin your deliverables


Step 9 (optional): Sign up for a meeting with Chris and Ellie

This assignment is due before class on <b>Wednesday, November 12th</b>.  You must work in groups on this project.  You must declare who is in your group when you turn your assignment.  Everyone in your group will receive the same grade on the assignment.
