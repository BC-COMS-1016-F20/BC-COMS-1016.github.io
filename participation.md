Participation Grade
===================

5% of your overall grade comes is assessed based on your "participation".  Ugh. You mean I have to do something for this class?  Yup. Here's what we give participation credit for:


* Coming to lecture.  We take attendance periodically throughout the lecture.  So far we have done it 3 times.
* Participating on Piazza
* Helping write lecture notes
* Helping improve the homework write ups for next year
