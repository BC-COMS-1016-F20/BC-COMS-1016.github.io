Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 1</span> 
=============================================================

This week's assignment counts as a deliverable toward your final project.  This assignment will be worth 10% of your final grade.  The goal of this assignment is to generate several ideas that you could refine into your final project.  You'll pitch the ideas in class, and get feedback from your classmates about how exciting and how feasible they think your ideas are.

###Step 1: Form a team

Your final project must be done in a group.  The size of the group can be 2-4 people.  Find some awesome people.  Do you remember what James Surowiecki says about groups?  They're best if they are composed of a diverse set of people.  So maybe you should try to pick out people who aren't already your friends.  Use the [Piazza message board](https://piazza.com/class/hzdefdi7bbl3xg?cid=5) to advertise that you're looking for teammates. 

###Step 2: Brainstorm ideas for your project

Your group should meet up and brainstorm ideas for the project.  You can come up with ideas on your own, or use [some of my ideas](http://crowdsourcing-class.org/project.html) as a starting point.  Your ideas are probably better than mine.

Here are some different kinds of projects that you could do:

* Come up with a human computation algorithm that solves some cool problem
* Conduct a social science experiment with the crowd or analyze data from social media
* Create tools that improve crowdsourcing platform for requesters or for workers
* Develop a business idea that uses the crowd like in the companies that we've been profiling


###Step 3: Flesh out 3 ideas

As a group, pick the 3 ideas that you like the most and start fleshing them out.   
Here are the considerations that you should take into account when developing your ideas.

###Step 4: Answer questions about the 3 ideas



###Step 5: Create a video pitch for your 3 ideas

You should produce a 90 second to 2 minute video for each of your ideas.  We will show these in class on 



This assignment is due before class on <b>Wednesday, October 8th</b>.  You must work in groups on this project.  You must declare who is in your group when you turn your assignment.
