  name_of_your_project: Füd-Füd
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Our website will crowdsource food delivery.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem of a demand for food delivery from restaurants that do not offer a delivery option.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Instacart is the closest thing.  They are still different, however.  Instacart hires employees and handles delivery of groceries, alcohol, and other bulk purchase items, but crucially not already made food.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: It will likely be college students look for food, money, or both.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Those who deliver food will get the bonus of working whenever they want to, delivering joy to those in their community, and of course the delivery fee.  Those who order food will get their food delivered to their door, at the time they want it, and for an agreed upon delivery fee.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: Some will provide the delivery service, needing only the skill of buying food and walking to an address.  Others will provide the demand for food, and they need nothing but an appetite and laziness.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Quality will be ensured by ratings that delivery users will rate customers on a few metrics, and customers will rate aspects of the delivery process.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Results from the crowd will be used to filter feeds for both the delivery user, and customers so that poorly rated users won't be matched again.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: To begin with, users can either post requests for food deliveries, or post opportunities for others to get food delivered.  If there is a match between users looking for food, and users going to get food soon, then they will be automatically asked to settle on a delivery fee.  Once this is set, delivery users will go buy the food and deliver it to the customer who will pay the delivery person on venmo.  Then, the customers will be asked to rate the delivery person on quality, speed, price, and kindness.  The delivery user will then be asked to rank the customer on clarity of request, fairness of the pay, and kindness.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: Our project is successful if users from both sides of the service can sign up, log in, post requests and opportunities, fulfill requests, deliver, accept delivery fees, and rate their experience.  This will determine a successful project, but a successful business would need to create a platform with steady demand and supply.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Not finding enough users to build demand or supply.  Having difficulty implementing all of the above features in time for the project's completion.  Communicating the benefits to both types of users.  Figuring out the payment flow might also prove difficult.  Ensuring quality will also be hard to do.

  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Upvotes and downvotes will be secretly aggregated to determine order of images in the search. <p>You can search for Philadelphia, and get specific images, or PA and get images from all over PA including the Philly images sorted by votes.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Step 1&#58; Photographers upload images and tag the location.<p>Step 2&#58; Users search for locations and view images (also vote and possibly purchase prints)<p>Step 3&#58; Our algorithm sorts images in a location by clout. <p>Step 4&#58; Machine learning algorithm recommends new locations based on user votes. 
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The project is successful if there is a good volume of contributors, locations have many high resolution images, and there is high upvote activity and usage per user.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Potential problems are in starting off. There will initially be only few tagged places to search from. If the photographer increase quickly, the viewership can increase fairly quickly too.

  name_of_your_project: Food Trafficking
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: A platform that publishes crowdsourced data about the traffic of restaurants/cafes/food trucks around Penn’s campus
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Students will no longer have to wait in extremely long lines at food trucks or experience long wait times at their favorite restaurants or be disappointed as they show up to a very crowded cafe. Food trafficking will help solve this as you will be able to see realtime updates about how crowded a certain is at all times.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Yelp
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A tool for crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Hungry students and food fanatics
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: It will be similar to Yelp's incentive program. People will enjoy helping each other as they want to be able to use this platform when they need it. We will also have a similar elite status for people that have contributed a lot to the platform.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide a realtime ranking of how crowded a place is currently. It does not require other skills other than the ability to be able to access the platform.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The crowd will be Penn students and we will use email/facebook profile confirmation for quality assurance. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: It will be aggregated on a web/mobile platform and updated each time a contributor contributes.

The platform will average out all contributors's rankings within the past 15 minutes to get the most accurate results. 
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: It can be evaluated by the number of people that are signed up to use it and the number of people that are contributors. It will also be evaluated by the accurately of the platform.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: A problem might occur if there aren't enough contributors. Another problem can occur if too many people are using the platform. We need to be able to scale the application.

  name_of_your_project: Critic Critic
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: It will compare media representation based on political party, age, gender, or race.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: There are inconsistencies in how people of different walks of life are described for the same actions or beliefs. However, when these inconsistencies are addressed, it is written off as a small-scale problem with one news network or anchor. Compiling a large volume of data about these representations could help to address media bias and unfair representation. <p>For an explicit example&#58;<p>http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/09yfp5/the-broads-must-be-crazy---belittled-women
  what_similar_projects_exist: Miss Representation is a documentary that discusses how men and women are portrayed differently in politics, but it draws on a lot of anecdotal evidence, and does not discuss political parties, age, or race. 
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, Social science experiment with the crowd
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Crowdflower Workers
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: We will pay them money. 
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide an assessment of the demographic background and the name of the subject of an article. They need to be able to read in English, as we will be focusing on American media. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will create a volume of test data to quiz them, and then cross-check their answers with known data about popular politicians. If they identify Barack Obama as a young white female, we can discard their responses. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will use their identifications of, for example, black politicians, to run our feature-maker and gather our most commonly used descriptors. If there is conflict over the subject (i.e., multiple politicians referenced equally), we will not use that article in our responses. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Step one&#58; crawl the web (can we borrow your web crawler?) for articles about politicians. <p>Step two&#58; ask crowdflower workers to identify the demographics of the subject of each article. <p>Step three&#58; sort (via the spreadsheet produced by crowdflower) the articles into demographic groups (male vs. female, black vs. white vs. Hispanic)<p>Step four&#58; run our script to extract features on each separate set<p>Step five&#58; look at the results
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If we have comprehensible keywords for each group that are useful for analysis (not stopwords), we will consider it a success. <p>If our data indicates that the same words are used along party lines, or across gender lines, we'll consider that a success for humanity and chalk media bias up to isolated incidences. 
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Articles that mention multiple politicians will confuse the crowd. The crowd may be unable to identify a subject's political party by the context of an article if the source assumes familiarity with this information. Focusing on American politics will probably limit crowd familiarity, and may limit effectiveness of the crowd if they are rushing through the articles.

  name_of_your_project: PennRepairs
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: 	A crowdsourced way to report broken lights, heaters, and other important objects around Penn facilities. 
  what_problem_does_it_solve: 	As an institution that charges a high rate of tuition, it would be embarrassing for prospective students to walk around campus and see broken items and embellishments, especially inside major buildings. For current administrators and students, the process to file a service request is often obtuse and varies from building to building. This would offer a centralized service that anyone with a camera phone can use. <p>
  what_similar_projects_exist: iFixIt (www.ifixit.com) is a crowdsourced repair manual that covers many common items such as phones, televisions, bicycles, etc. This is more focused on self-repair than the reporting of public repairs. WhoCanFixMyCar.com is a service that matches people with broken cars to people who can service their car for their specific problem. Commercial enterprises like Amazon have services where a customer can take a picture of an item if it is broken and send it into customer service.<p>
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn students + Crowdflower workers
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Hopefully, the civic duty that Penn students feel towards maintaining the campus, in addition to the desire to not send formal requests to faculty services, will encourage them to send in pictures. If we do not get adequate participation, we can always pivot to scraping images from the web with the necessary location metadata. Obviously, this project works best if we get ~200-300 images of things that people think is broken. To expand our field, we can also include broken signs, labels, and other “minor” issues. <p>	Crowdflower workers will be incentivized to participate with a monetary payment.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: 	People who send in pictures will need the ability to judge if something is broken or not. They would only need the ability to keep their eyes out for broken items and identify them as such if they come across them. The Crowdflower workers would simply need to classify items based on how broken they appear to be.<p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: 	The pictures that are being sent in are hard to verify unless we did it by hand, which can be possible if it’s limited to a set of 200-300 pictures. Crowdflower worker quality can be tested with an initial quiz that shows their relative accuracy.<p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: 	We can use a simple API such as Twilio to allow people to text pictures to a phone number. The Crowdflower results can simply be aggregated into a spreadsheet and CSV file that we can download and compares the crowd answers to our labels.<p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: 	First, we have to gather a set of 50-100 images, either from the Internet of from buildings around Penn, of items that are broken and visibly need fixing and items that look fine, and we would classify themselves by hand. We would put this set up on Crowdflower and ask them to classify the images into “definitely needs fixing”, “might need fixing”, or “looks fine”. We’d then take the labels that Crowdflower gave us and compare them to our hand-given labels to verify that the crowd and our team have the same general definition of “broken”. <p>      Next, we would try building our own classifier with a large corpus of images based on the features that we observed to be important in our initial phase. Ideally, we’d want to deconstruct the image into certain vectors that can help indicate a broken item, like uneven lighting or uneven structure in the image. If that has limited success, we can still try and classify the images as broken or not based on their location or even by the person who sent the picture in, among other associated metadata. <p>	Finally, we’d put these set of images on Crowdflower again and compare our classifier’s performance with the actual labels the crowd workers give us. We could put our entire dataset up to get all statistics on precision and recall, or just put the images that our classifier selected as “definitely needs fixing”.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: 	Using a standard statistics like precision and recall. Also, we can try and find the average distance between the label vector and the crowd workers vector (the lower “distance”, the better). <p>
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: 	The biggest issue will be actually getting a critical mass of images for which to perform statistically significant machine learning on. One possible workaround is to extend the scope of the pictures to beyond just Penn’s campus, but that poses obvious problems with data sanity and standardization. I don’t think it’s infeasible to get the quick set of 50-100 images just to do an initial test for validation purposes. If we have a hard time just getting 50 images, then we may need to change our approach. Another big issue involves items that are broken internally, but that are not visible to the naked eye. We would try to discourage users from taking pictures of such items at the beginning, and maybe introduce them later once we have a solid model for visually broken items.<p>

  name_of_your_project: EbolAware
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: EbolAware determines how people are reacting to Ebola by analyzing data from social media.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem that we don't know how people react to things that are outside of their control and that don't immediately affect them. Ebola is a perfect case of this for most people. It is an epidemic happening on a different continent, yet it is a constant topic of discussion here in North America and on news outlets daily. Someone in the UN said that Ebola could be contained in 6 to 9 months but only if a massive global response was implemented. The start of a large scale global response is rooted in each individual's response to the crisis, and that is what I want to figure out more about. 
  what_similar_projects_exist: None that I know of, except polls on news websites about it. 
  what_type_of_project_is_it: social science experiment with social media
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: The workers on crowdflower.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Monetarily.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide a rating of the different emotions of the tweet that they are working on and the intensity of the emotion. For this they just need a working knowledge of English. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: I will have multiple people working on the same tweet in order to verify the results, and I will have sample tweets that I work on to compare to the answers of the workers.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: I will average all the data and then find the top ten sentiments about Ebola and rank them in order of average intensity. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: The first step is to crawl Twitter for tweets about Ebola, this will be done by me. The next step is to create a Crowdflower survey that takes several tweets, including a test one that I already know the general answer to, and gives it to a worker to gage the emotions and level of intensity of those emotions in the tweets. The last step is to aggregate and analyze the data, which I will do.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: I will consider this successful if by the end I have a result where there are recurring themes in people's tweets about Ebola, that the crowdworkers have noticed.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Judging the level of intensity of emotion within a tweet is very subjective, so I think having a consistent way for the workers to judge the tweets will be the most difficult problem to solve. Another problem might be that there are such wide ranges of emotions and intensity levels that there are no clear sentiments towards Ebola on Twitter.

  name_of_your_project: What Should I Cook?
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: This app attempts to solve the problems of all those people who have ever wondered, What should I cook? given a full fridge and no recipes.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Matching available ingredients for cooking to recipes made with those ingredients
  what_similar_projects_exist: Supercook, as far as I know, does this without the image recognition part
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone who can recognize food images
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Tasks that pay for typing in names of food recognized in images, much like the receipt tasks that dominate MT.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They provide training parameters for the OpenCV learner, no skills required
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Test questions would be used
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The plan involves using the MT or CF APIs to automate machine learning for the image recognition, aggregates would be the end result of each task batch.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowd&#58; responsible for looking at an image of food items and listing the items that are in the images (i.e. tomato, egg, watermelon, etc.)<p>Automated&#58; learn on sets of images to identify discrete foods, call the crowdsourcing API, download images from users, call BigOven API to look up recipes.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If the image recognition can effectively give back more than 50% of the discrete ingredients from a picture of the inside of a stocked refrigerator, I would call the project a success.<p>On a more qualitative note, the project would be successful if the data flow from image upload -> classifier -> recipe worked.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: OpenCV is difficult to work with, the time it would take to train a classifier for image recognition is non-trivial, and especially parsing out discrete food items from an image of an open fridge seems to be a very complex problem.<p>Crowdsourcing problems include faking data, not agreeing with the classifier, and costs.

  name_of_your_project: DesignMind
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: DesignMind attempts to crowdsource voting on company logos, giving users the feedback that they want on a logo's effectiveness without all that focus group testing.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Currently, brands find it difficult to know what makes a good logo and resort to lots of focus groups and A/B testing.  This is expensive and inefficient when crowdsourcing exists and the opinions of many can be decided very quickly.
  what_similar_projects_exist: 99designs.com crowdsources logo designs from designers and then lets brands pick from the end results, this would be somewhat the opposite of that but in the same vein.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Pay-per-vote task, looking at each logo image and deciding which one is best for a particular case.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide all of the aggregate data that is returned to the user; basically, DesignMind attempts to be a gateway for companies to reach many people at once and get their thoughts and opinions.  They won't need any skills, since anyone could be a potential customer.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: One of the reach goals might be to implement worker filtering, so that some companies could target their desired audience for votes.  Otherwise, the quality of the crowd shouldn't be a problem since the only data needed is the vote.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Using the MT or CF APIs to gather the information and then present that back to the brand.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowd&#58; responsible for voting on logo designs, choosing which one is better<p>Automated&#58; uploading design images, sending tasks out to workers, aggregating results, displaying results to brands, targeting different audiences.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The project will be successful if the flow from app to task back to app works as expected and is quick enough for a potential customer to get feedback in a short amount of time.  Also, the success will depend on how expensive it ends up being to get a good chunk of aggregated data, versus the classic focus group cost.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: One problem could be that after pushing out the logo vote task, it takes too long to return any results.  Another would be the cost of the task itself, and yet another is the fact that brands still have to come up with their own logos in the first place in order to upload them.

  name_of_your_project: Campus Cribs
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Market for Finding and Trading off-campus houses on campus.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Every year, a new class of rising juniors seeks off-campus housing. The outgoing seniors can either pass their lease down to a group of their choosing or let the realtors decide who gets the house. In addition, the rising seniors often opt to look for a different off-campus house that will better suit their needs the following year. Right now, all of these people either have to know someone who's house will be up for lease or have to go to one of the campus realtors to find options.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Currently, Rental companies exist which pair buyers and sellers of houses, as well as renters and landlords. However, as far as we know, there is no service that helps students see all of their off-campus options in one place.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn undergraduates and graduate students.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: The algorithm will be individually rational, meaning that the users are guaranteed to exit the process with a house that either meets or exceeds the house that they go into the process with. If they don't find a better one, they keep their own. The program will collect features of their house and their preferences for a new one. It will match users for hand-offs and even for trades.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will need access to the internet and a upenn.edu email address.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The users will have no incentive to lie about what their house offers because if they do and find a potential trade, the other party will quickly realize the falseness of the first party's offering and the first party will not get the trade they wanted.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will allow users to sign up for the service and create a profile for bother their own house and the housing options they seek.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: First, users sign up and create personal preference profiles and profiles of their current house, including location, amenities, bedrooms, bathrooms, prices, condition, etc. They are then entered into a pool of other options on campus. If a match between their preferences and another house occurs, the two parties are connected automatically. If a potential three or more way trade occurs, the trade will be suggested to all of the parties automatically. If the trade is accepted, the users can take their houses off the market. We can collect data about offers and then sell that data to the landlords. This will be useful information for them about the demand for each of their properties, and will allow them to rethink pricing to match that demand.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We will collect data surrounding how often matches are made and how often those trades are accepted.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Consumer adoption may be a problem, especially because by the time we finish implementing the platform a lot of the properties will be signed for next year.

  name_of_your_project: ShopForMe
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: ShopForMe attempts to use the opinions of thousands of crowdsourced users to act as a personal style consultant, judging articles of clothing for users to buy.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Most people dress in order to look good to other people.  Why not get thousands of opinions from those very people instead of only relying on yours and maybe one other person's? We can use crowdsourced results to decide which clothes to buy among multiple articles of clothing and multiple sets of clothing.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Sew Love is a Kickstarter project that crowdsources clothing designs, which is similar to this project, except that this one takes existing designs and has crowds vote on them.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm, A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Pay per vote, tasks that involve looking at different clothes and picking which one is best.  Paying for the opinions of others.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: The workers will provide their own opinions on what styles look best and aggregating the collected data provides the app with its final judgment on which article of clothing to buy.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Since the question is only asking for their opinion, unless the crowd purposefully lies about what they think, there should be no problem.  The quality of the data is averaged out over many judgments.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: All of the results for a given set of pictures/clothes will be aggregated into one final result.  The original user will then receive the result judgments and have a better sense of what to buy.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowd&#58; responsible for looking and comparing urls that hold clothing items.  The task would be to judge which item they liked more.<p>Automated&#58; sending tasks out to workers, ingesting urls from users, giving users the final feedback, aggregating data, visualizing data in a useful manner.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If the project is successful, the final decision returned by the crowdsourced task should roughly equate to that of the majority opinion when asking people.  The result should also not take very long to return, and the task shouldn't cost much.  The cost of the task will be the most limiting part, since a thousand judgments is on the order of tens of dollars, which is unsustainable.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Cost, as described above.<p>Difficult to separate clothing into different types of articles, thus making it different to compare a sweater to a scarf.

  name_of_your_project: ParkYeah
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: ParkYeah is a mobile application that aggregates the GPS data of people looking for parking in order to provide users with areas where they will have the best chance of finding street parking.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Finding street parking is typically a very frustrating task, especially in in a big city - daily/weekly/yearly parking patterns can be very difficult to guess and can affect a driver's willingness to make a trip to begin with.  This app will use gps data from people looking to find parking in order to estimate the probability of finding parking in certain areas.  Other users can use this information to make informed decisions about where to look for parking to make their search shorter and less frustrating.  
  what_similar_projects_exist: There are a number of other park-assisting apps (many which are city-specific) but these often only geared towards metered spots or garages.  None use the wisdom of crowds. 
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Any urban residents looking for street parking
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Using the app will help users save, time, money and gas while looking for parking.  Therefore they will have an incentive to use the app and provide their own GPS data.  
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They simply provide their GPS data while they look for parking.  An internal machine learning algorithm then uses this data to compute the probability of finding parking in each area (e.g. city block) for all users based on the searching patterns of people using the app. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Users will only be giving their GPS data, and therefore cannot lie.  The probably estimates made via machine learning can be cross-checked by having crowdworkers identify the parking congestion levels of certain areas by looking at satellite images.  This will be used to make sure the machine learning classifier is accurate.  
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: GPS data points from the crowd will be fed into a machine learning algorithm (see above) that outputs a parking-probability map of the area.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Crowds download the mobile app and open it on their phones.  This simultaneously shows the user a parking-probability map of the area that they are in while taking in a stream of GPS data points form the user currently looking for parking in order to make the map more accurate.  People looking for parking rely on other peoples data and vise versa, so the process is somewhat cyclical&#58;<p>- user is shown computed probability map<p>- GPS stream is sent to central server<p>- algorithm updates probability map given new data points<p>- updated map is refreshed on mobile app   
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: ParkYeah will be successful if many users rely on it for parking information - this will be an indication that it saves people time and money.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: The machine learning aspect will likely be difficult to make accurate.  It will be important to guess information like when exactly and where a user ultimately finds parking, and use this to accurately guess how congested the area must be.

  name_of_your_project: PennCrowd
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: This app will let students know how crowded different campus spots are.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Students often go to a place on campus only to find that it is too crowded for them to be productive. Whether its the gym, a dining hall or a study building, this can be a huge pain in the neck. The app will help students decide whether or not to start venturing toward some hot spot, and potentially find alternatives.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Foursquare is a similar platform, but it is not specific (or useful) to campus. Wharton also shows you how many GSRs are booked at one time, but it does not show you how crowded other parts of the building are.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn Students
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Students will participate automatically, without changing their behaviors. We plan to utilize a PennCard API to determine how many students check into different spots on campus, and at what times. Checking in by swiping a PennCard is something students do already.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They do not need any specific skills and will provide real time information about how many people are in each location.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will ask students to rate the accuracy of the app's prediction once they arrive at a spot. We will use this, along with checkins and timestamp data to optimize the machine learning algorithm.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will collect data from the PennCard API.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: A student walks into Huntsman at night (or any other campus location that requires a swipe) and swipes in with their PennCard. Other students can then open the app and check how crowded the area is based on how many other students have recently checked in.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We will collect feedback in the app and will also collect data on how often students are using it, and whether or not they continue to use it after using it a few times.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: There may not be a useful PennCard API or the University may not allow us to use the information regarding individuals' whereabouts.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: MarketChatter allows an analysis of the stock sentiment by examining data from social media and news articles.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Investors frequently want to know how lay people perceive a company. Spotting upticks in volume in the number of times a company is referenced in the media allows people to monetize momentum as well as gauge retail interest in companies. This also allows investors to recognize bad news even before a company press release if a lot of consumers rant about the product on social media platforms<p>
  what_similar_projects_exist: StockTwits is a financial communications platform that makes analyzes sentiment by looking at twitter feeds.<p>Bloomberg incorporated real time twitter information into its terminals through the TWTR<GO> command.<p>StockPulse makes use of MIT research on stock sentiment analysis as a basis for its business model.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: The crowd will primarily consist of customers who are talking about their experience with products on social networks. The crowd also includes journalists posting news articles about a company.  
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Customers inherently like talking about any extreme negative or extreme positive experiences with any particular firms. Social media allows them to rant about their experiences. Talking about their experiences also helps them feel as though they are helping out friends in their network to avoid bad opportunities and pursue good opportunities. On the other hand, journalists are naturally incentivized in producing content that generates a lot views since that affects their standing in the media industry. <p>
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: The customers are essentially providing reviews on a voluntary service. The nature of the project implementation means that it only includes customers that can interact on social medial. Journalists just need a website to post their content. The project will scrape articles from across the web that reference a particular company. <p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: A quick check for QC is whether that consume or journalist has ever posted content on social media or the web in the past. If this is the first post, then it could simply be a fake user. Another check is whether the user has posted multiple times across different social networks in which case the user is is simply trying to increase his own personal influence. <p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The project will scrape information from twitter and across other social media and news sites. This aggregation will provide the data necessary for the sentiment analysis. <p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Customers voluntarily post information about their experiences online. Journalist post news stories about companies online. Both of these steps are done by the crowd. The program would scrape the web for data about a particular company. This is done automatically. The data points are pushed back to a crowdsourcing platform to have a crowd of workers assess the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.<p>
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The project evaluation will consist of taking a ticker or company name as input and seeing whether a report that summarizes the sentiment for the company currently is generated. <p>
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: When scraping for data, it is important to isolate data that is current; in other words, remove stale data from a long time ago that is still posted on the web. This project only gives a snapshot of sentiment. It maybe helpful to see sentiment for a particular stock temporally. <p>

  name_of_your_project: CrowdCheck
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: CrowdCheck is a tool that utilizes crowdsourcing to pre-parse and check for overly intrusive terms of service agreements, particularly in the area of privacy policies.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: In today’s digital world, the distribution of personal data is a primary concern for users of popular websites. However, even the privacy-conscious often do not take the time to sift through the excessively long agreements that must be accepted prior to using most software applications and websites.
  what_similar_projects_exist: There is a project called Terms of Service; Didn’t Read that has very similar goals, but this project has struggled to obtain “enough data to make solid comparisons yet” and can not even be used to for popular services such as Facebook.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Human computation algorithm
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: The workers on Mechanical Turk are the members of our crowd.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: We will use monetary incentives that potentially increase for a recurring user as he/she builds a successful track record over time.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: The crowd members will assist in categorizing privacy policies into different levels of intrusiveness. This will require basic skills such as reading comprehension and preferably a familiarity with legal terms.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The primary method of quality control is via monetary incentives, as a contributor will only be exposed to increased earnings if their previous categorizations were found to be correct. Additionally, a pre-test will be implemented to ensure that contributors have a basic understanding of the legal terms often found in these agreements. Finally, the users of the tool can optionally provide feedback on the recommendations the tool provides.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: This project will aggregate results directly from contributors as they complete the tasks on Mechanical Turk.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: The first step will be to scrape the privacy policies of various websites and split them into small chunks, such as paragraphs, in an automated process. Next, crowdsourced workers will apply labels to paragraphs of privacy policies such as ‘Tracks you on other websites’. Finally, an automated process will aggregate the data collected from contributors to assign overall ratings to websites.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: Feedback from users will help indicate how accurate the ratings are. Additionally, if the tool gathers enough support, companies being categorized will be incentivized to notify us of false negative categorizations. At a more general level, the goal is not only to aid users but to also incentivize companies to provide fair policies. Thus, one way to measure success would be to consistently check websites for updated policies that may be in response to categorizations presented by this tool.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: The primary problem in implementing this project will be to determine a standardized set of labels for crowdsourced contributors to flag as ‘present’ or ‘not present’. Generating this set of labels could be a crowdsourced task of its own.

  name_of_your_project: DealFlow
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: DealFlow essentially serves as as a platform for idea generation for Venture Capital firms by crowdsourcing the sourcing aspect of a VC analyst’s job. 
  what_problem_does_it_solve: A large part of VC analyst’s job consists of calling companies and creating lists of companies available for sale that meet a particular sector/theme requirement. By the nature of type of investing employed by VC firms, the opportunity set primarily consists of private companies. <p>After VC firms find a big picture secular technology theme they want to invest in, they need to compile a list of companies in that space. This is a difficult task since the targets are mostly small, private companies. 
  what_similar_projects_exist: Financial databases like CapitalIQ provide some information on private companies, but it doesn’t fulfill the aspect of a VC’s job such as contacting companies and seeing if they are available as prospective investments.<p>PitchBook provides lists of companies that are already VC or PE backed and doesn’t effectively list prospective VC opportunities.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: The crowd will consist of entrepreneurs and business people. These people have social clout. They all have experiences with different types of business models and various sectors. 
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Members will be partially compensated by the volume of unique businesses they can list that meet a particular theme for investing i.e. cloud computing for education. Members will primarily receive compensation through an incentive fee if a deal listed by them on the platform eventually generates a successful lead for a VC firm. This incentive fee can serve as a pseudo transaction fee for a PE firm. <p>
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: The crowd would need to have knowledge of smaller, private businesses. The crowd also needs to have an extensive network of business contacts to create a more meaningful list of prospective targets. This means that the members of the crowd can generate proprietary deal flow, which is the holy grail of VC investing.<p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The crowd quality will be assessed by a check of whether the businesses provided in the list actually exist. The company can be cross referenced with publicly listed companies to ensure it is private. The website that is listed along with each respective company can be evaluated to see if it contains the tag words for the investment theme being evaluated. <p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The aggregation will essentially take place over a website where businesses idea lists will get uploaded by the crowd under a respective investment theme. <p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: The website will provide an exhaustive, updating list of investment themes that are interesting for VCs. The crowd will create lists of businesses that meet the various themes. The quality control described earlier will be done automatically.<p>
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The evaluation of the project will be determined by whether quality lists can be generated for different investment themes. <p>
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: The main problem will be getting the target crowd to be aware of the the product. Since this will be a new model for investing, both the crowd and VC firms may have initial skepticism. <p>

  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will use iterations to ensure the quality. Basically we hope that the crowd can provide the training data for algorithm. The algorithm in return will generate better tasks for the crowd. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: I don’t have a clear idea on the forms of tasks yet. I plan to ask the crowd match key words with news articles or extract key words from news articles. For this task I can create an algorithm to filter the results and find common ones. I might also ask the crow to write summaries of my generated results. For this task I would probably use iterations. 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: I don’t have a clear idea yet. I need to do more research before designing the tasks.

  name_of_your_project: Rent-a-Kitchen
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Application that allows student users to rent kitchens from peers in exchange for food or money.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Many students who live in dorms without kitchens suffer from the low quality of accessible food.<p>
  what_similar_projects_exist: The Culinary Studio allows customers to rent kitchens within a community. Kitchen Share allows customers to rent kitchen utensils.<p>
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Penn Students
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: On the one hand, the students looking to use the kitchen will be incentivized by the prospect of using a kitchen. On the other hand, the students looking to rent out their kitchens will be incentivized by either the money or the food.<p>
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: The kitchen providers will provide their kitchen real estate. Kitchen equipment is provided at the provider’s discretion. The kitchen seekers will provide either money or freshly prepared food. In the case of the freshly prepared grub, the seekers will need culinary skills.<p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: A rating and feedback system for both kitchen providers and kitchen seekers will be used. The ratings will be made available to all parties so seekers can choose providers they are satisfied with and providers can accept only seekers they have faith in. If the seeker is not satisfied with the state of the provider’s kitchen upon arrival, he/she will not have to pay in food or money (providers of the kitchens will be audited before they are allowed to rent out their space so that no sketchy locales fall through the crack). The food quality of the food prepared by the seekers will be FDA approved. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The results from the crowd will be aggregated in an application (either mobile or web). A user seeking to rent a kitchen will be able to use the application to search for users who are willing to provide kitchens. Additionally, kitchen providers will be able to use the application to connect with kitchen seekers and obtain food or money in return.<p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: Everyone willing to rent out their kitchens will post the times and location of their kitchen availability. Kitchen providers will include any restrictions enforced in their kitchen, such as food allergies or dietary restrictions. They will also indicate whether they want to be paid in cash money or in fresh grub. Kitchen seekers will search on the site/app when they want to use a kitchen, and our state-of-the-art pairing program will give them suggestions on nearby kitchens that match their timeslot. Kitchen seekers can then send a request to a kitchen provider, who can approve or reject the request based on the seeker’s reputation (evaluated through ratings). If approved, the seeker and provider coordinate any sharing between kitchen equipment and ingredients.  After the seeker has completed, both seeker and provider rate each other.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We will evaluate our project by getting a few users (both kitchen seekers and kitchen providers) to try our application. We would then ask the users to fill out a survey about their experience using the application. The survey would include such questions as “Rate your overall experience using the application,” “Would you be interested in using this application in the future,” etc. The feedback from this survey would be the primary method we would use to determine the success of the project.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: There are safety and privacy concerns. Kitchen owners will be allowing strangers come cook in their dorm. Users could steal from the home, accidently start a fire, spill milk on the floor, etc. On the user end, students may feel awkward cooking in random people’s homes.<p>

  name_of_your_project: Identifying Geographical Biases in Gender Roles (sorry it's boring...but I thought it made sense given the topic!)
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Use surveying people’s preferences and interest to guess their gender in a study to figure out how gender roles play out in different geographical locations.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: Helping to develop a better understanding of how gender roles are defined by society (our interests and preferences) and how these things differ throughout the world. We can better understand nature vs nurture in terms of how we identify.<p>
  what_similar_projects_exist: Hunch used to do something similar, except instead of gender, it would guess things like political views.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: Social science experiment with the crowd
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: A diverse group of people from all over the world - hopefully a strong combination of men, women and other-gender-identifying individuals, as well as a diversity of people from different locations and age groups.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: We will pay them via Crowdflower.<p>
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will answer several questions about themselves - do they like the city, do they prefer the outdoors, whether they enjoy cooking, what their dream life will be in several years etc. And then they will tell us how they identify (and if necessary, where they are from). They will likely need to know how to read English - though potentially we can translate.  <p>
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will throw in a “dummy question” to make sure they are paying attention - for example, “what color is the grass&#58; green black grey white” and check for a real answer - for example, real text that has real English that makes sense every hundred or so questions.<p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: We will primarily use multiple choice question to gauge preferences, and potentially for the short answer questions - we will parse out certain verbs and nouns from a dictionary and put that in as interests - for example, “I  see myself as a construction worker” might get parsed as “construction” or “worker” and see if there are any strong correlations. <p>Alternatively, We can also do a separate Crowdflower task to verify the results and have Crowdworkers parse relevant verbs and nouns for us and then machine learn a small test set - and see if we can predict accurately. We will primarily use multiple choice question to gauge preferences, and potentially for the short answer questions - we will parse out certain verbs and nouns from a dictionary and put that in as interests - for example, “I  see myself as a construction worker” might get parsed as “construction” or “worker” and see if there are any strong correlations. <p>
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: We will put together a survey asking people to fill out their interests, preferences and life goals. We will put this on Crowdflower. We will collect hopefully around 10,000 responses or so.<p>From the data we collected, we will create a small data set of about 1,000 responses whose gender we have collected. We will create a unigram based on this for males and females and use this to build a classifier.<p>We will then run this on the rest our data and see if we can predict whether they are females or males based on the information we got from the survey.<p>We can then check this against the information they gave us (are they really male or female).<p>Then we can map correlations and geography in some sort of data visualization that represents how gender roles have defined interests and preferences across the world.<p>
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We can look at the final data - and see how accurate how classifier was at predicting gender and also from the visualization, we can see if there were any real strong correlations based on geographic location (for example, if some places have stronger preference-gender correlation, which would be really interesting).
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Not getting enough meaningful data, people not being as transparent as they could be during the survey, potentially people being lazy and not putting real answers. We could potentially combat this by releasing the visualization at the end and giving them a preview of what it would look like to increase interest in the project.<p>Resulting bias in answers if we indicate what the project is for.

  name_of_your_project: Note My Time, Note My Problem
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Application that allows students to split up the note taking process and share lecture notes.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: For various reasons, students might like the option to not take notes during lecture. For example, some students learn better by focusing on listening to the lecture rather than frantically scribbling down notes. However, in many classes written notes prove essential when studying for a test. Our solution to this problem crowdsources notetaking to allow everyone to maximize their learning potential.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Course Hero allows users to buy study aid materials or hire tutors for classes. StudyBlue allows users to share notes and flashcards with other users. Koofers provides access to notes and old exams. GradeGuru provides a study platform where students can share and find class-specific study notes. The main difference between these companies and ours is that ours crowd sources the work in a unique manner, increasing the quality of the notes and guaranteeing the existence of notes for a given class. It is also free for anyone who contributes to the note taking process.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Students taking classes at Penn.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: The setup of the idea is self-incentivizing because each of the participants directly reaps the benefit of the work done. Each user gets access to the lecture notes that they contribute to. Therefore, they have incentive to participate because they can get access to all the lecture notes by only taking notes for a few time slots.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: They will provide notes on the class material. The skills required are your basic college note-taking skills (College 101 material).
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Participants note-taking ability will be rated by their peers. If someone is taking clearly subpar notes, his peers will rank him down. After a certain number of down-ranks, the participant will be kicked out of the group.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Each person’s notes will added to a Google Doc-esque document, which will provide for real-time aggregation of the notes taken.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: First, participants will enroll on our website for a class. Then, the students in each class are split into even size groups of maximum 20 people each. The groups will be assigned randomly and the names will be shared among the group to incentive students to take notes. Students in each group will sign up for 20 minute time slots, first-come-first-serve, for which they will be responsible for taking notes (e.g. 11&#58;00 - 11&#58;20). There will be two students taking notes in each time slot. During the class, each participant is free to listen, note-free and care-free, until it is his/her time to take notes. At the end of the class, each participant will upload his/her notes to a shared document and everyone in the group will have an entire lecture’s worth of notes for a fraction of the note-taking time. The note takers will be rated by other members of their group based on the quality of the notes. The users will not see these ratings; they will be used internally to warn and remove users that have consistently bad reviews. If a student misses his/her time slot without presenting an acceptable excuse from the rest of the group, he/she will be given a warning and if it is repeated, the person will be kicked out of the group.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: We will test our implementation with a test group and evaluate based on quality of produced notes.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Although we will implement a rating system to rate participants who are slacking, there is always the worry of free-loaders who will join a group without contributing their fair share. Also, there is the issue of people spamming the Google Doc or other note-taking doc with irrelevant junk.

  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: The workers only get paid if the work gets chosen. To weed out nonsense, workers can work together as both internal verification and to mitigate the work, to create an optimal planning experience, where the user will get the most for their money while still receiving quality services and goods.

  name_of_your_project: The Music Database
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: The IMDb of music, but assembled by humans.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: There is no comprehensive database of all music, artists, albums, and mixtapes, that ranges from unknown bands to mainstream pop artists. Given this immensity of the music industry, it is a very daunting task to code software that collates all artists and their works without using any crowdsourcing. Furthermore, people around the world have such a diverse taste in music, and can be very big fans of so many artists, that utilizing crowdsourcing may not only build a more comprehensive database, but a more accurate one as well.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Spotify and iTunes have this information, but they are modes of listening to music, and are not music industry databases. This site will be similar to IMDb, but for music instead of movies.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anyone who has access to a computer and internet
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: There will not be a monetary incentive to participate, because if the website happens to be successful, there will be a lot of contributors inputting a lot of data, rendering a monetary incentive unfeasible. Instead, a point system will be designed to reward contributors, and bolster their reputation on the site. However, the site will mainly rely on the desire of fans of artists to contribute to those artists’ pages – this may especially be the case for a fan who wants to increase recognition of a relatively unknown band or artist.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: No specific skills are needed, besides information or access to information about an artist that they wish to put on the site. The site will be organized by artist, and each artist’s page will have all of their albums, and all of the songs on each album. A contributor can provide as much or as little information about an artist as they want, so long as it is accurate. 
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: No specific skills are needed, besides information or access to information about an artist that they wish to put on the site. The site will be organized by artist, and each artist’s page will have all of their albums, and all of the songs on each album. A contributor can provide as much or as little information about an artist as they want, so long as it is accurate. 
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The results will be aggregated via an algorithm that takes into account what exactly the contributors are saying about the information that they are editing (whether it agrees or disagrees with the current information), and weighing such contributions based on the points that the contributor has (which is an indication of how reliable the contributor is). 
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: The site will present the crowd with a template that can be filled in with the artist information, making it very easy for contributors, and creating a fairly uniform look throughout the site, much like IMDb. The input of information is all done by the crowd – the crowd will essentially build the whole site. Some quality control algorithms will be implemented, however, such cross checking site information with Spotify’s API. This would be an automated process, not involving the crowd. 
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: The main indication of the success of the project is how many pages accumulate on the site, and how detailed such pages are. A robust implementation would include data about the number of people contributing and using the site, which are also metrics that can indicate success. 
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Aggregating the contributor’s and ensuring that the site has accurate information will be a great challenge, but I do not see it is as a problem.

  name_of_your_project: Crowdsourcing for Cash Flows
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Crowdsourcing for Cash Flows is a project designed to harness crowd sourcing to accurately judge the sentiment of articles relating to stocks.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: This helps to solve the problem of market research, and would allow retail investors (people like you and me) to conduct the same sentiment research conducted by analysts at large firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock.
  what_similar_projects_exist: There are some sentiment analysis tools available currently.  These include StockFluence, The Stock Sonar, Sentdex, and SNTMNT, all of which perform sentiment analysis on Twitter or other news feeds.  
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: Anybody can be a member of our crowd, as it is easy for humans to determine the sentiment of a piece of written text.  Also, to alleviate concerns about obscure financial terminology, definitions of common terms would be provided.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: We will incentivize them to participate by paying them a certain amount of money for a collection of accurately analyzed text.  For example, we may pay 1 cent per 3 articles read and analyzed.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: These workers will be essentially creating labeled training data for a sentiment classifier algorithm to be trained on.  They only need to be able to read and understand which words are positive, and which words are negative, and how a sentence sentiment consists of the sum of its parts.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: I will ensure the quality the crowd provides by creating many test cases on CrowdFlower to ensure the validity of my results.  I will also give a few clear examples, and a list of definitions of commonly used financial terms, so users will understand the articles.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: CrowdFlower automatically aggregates the results from the crowd, allowing the job posters (us) to easily download the data once the job is finished.  Additionally, we might break up this data by stock, in order to see which stocks have the brightest outlook.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: First, we will need to create a list of links to online articles and tweets that workers will follow in order to analyze the articles at those links.  To create our test cases, we will follow those links manually, and then analyze those articles ourselves.  Once analyzed, the sentiment will be entered into the CrowdFlower job, and then once the job is finished, we will be able to automatically download this newly labeled data to either train a classifier, or to analyze on our own to determine the best stocks.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: If we are able to get reliably scored data that is precise and accurate (ideally would love perfect recall, but it is hard to manually score so many articles), then this would be considered a success.  There are many uses for the collected data, from training classifiers to making our own predictions about the stocks.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: We foresee a scenario in which some crowd members may not understand some articles due to the financial terminology.  We will try to mitigate these factors by providing workers with definitions of common terms, as well as examples to help them understand how we would like the articles scored.  Additionally, it may be difficult to find huge amounts of articles very easily, and may become a fairly manual task.

  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: We will use multiple HIITs to verify survey answers.<p>Potential matches will be generated on existing similarities (already setting a certain level of quality) and the matches that the matchmakers choose will be only made if multiple matchmakers choose the match.<p>
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: The survey data will aggregated by what the majority of crowdworkers choose.<p>The potential matches will become matches when a predetermined number of matchmakers vote for a given potential match
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: First, users of the matchmaking service enter links to their social media profiles<p>Next, HIITs are created for crowdworkers to answer survey questions about the person based on the provided social media profiles.<p>These results are aggregated into 5-10 key characteristics about the person.<p>Based on other people with similar characteristics, potential matches are generated for each user.<p>These potential matches are then posted on a site online where matchmakers can vote “yes” or “no” for each potential match. (Tinder / Hot or Not style interface)<p>If a certain potential match reaches a given number of “no” votes, it is removed from the site. If it receives a certain number of “yes” votes before that happens, the two people are sent each other’s social media profiles to get to know each other.<p>For every match that occurs, the matchmakers who voted yes are notified.
