Market Research <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 2</span> 
=============================================================
This week we will be looking at the wealth of companies that use crowdsourcing as part of their business. ('wealth' [sense 2, not sense 1](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=wealth&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=). [Word sense disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation) is still an open problem!)

This assignment has two deliverables.  
1. A short write-up of the company or project that you are researching.
2. A slideshow and video that you will use for an in-class presentation.

This assignment can be done individually or in pairs.

First, please choose a [presentation date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOcI7BJUQGeG3Pb3oZPRqfTt2JYwRnjnTqImex9qsSQ/edit?usp=sharing) and a company. You will need to give a short 5 to 10 minute presentation on your company on your chosen date, answering the following questions:

- What incentives does it offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?

Turn in a short writeup (~ 1 page) answering these questions by <b>Wednesday, September 25</b>. Your presentation slides are due on the day you give your presentation.
