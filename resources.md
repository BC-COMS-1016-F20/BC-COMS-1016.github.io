Resources 
=============================================================

###General Python resources

- Python itself has good documentation and a decent getting started page [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html).
- Python gives a list of good tutorials [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). Many are focused on people with no programming background, but two that seem a bit less introductory are the [Python in 10 minutes](http://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) tutorial, and [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).
- There is a [Coursera course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) starting September 15th. Thanks to whoever mentioned that in class! Was it Morgan? I am still learning names. :-)
- I tend to find it easiest to learn languages with some application in mind, so I learned python using the [Intro to NLP in Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/). Highly recommend as a great way to learn two very useful skills at once!

###More advanced Python resources 

- [Boto, a Python library for MTurk’s API](https://github.com/boto/boto). There is decent (although not perfect) documentation [here](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/mturk.html) and a good tutorial available [here](http://www.toforge.com/2011/04/boto-mturk-tutorial-create-hits/).
- [Scikit-learn]http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an amazingly easy library for doing machine learning in Python. It is also wonderfully verbosely documented with tons of examples.
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) is a great library for doing natural language processing in Python.  
- [Python client for the CrowdFlower API](https://github.com/peoplepattern/crowdflower).  There’s a tutorial on the [People Pattern blog](http://www.peoplepattern.com/crowdflower-python-client-crowdflower-api/).
