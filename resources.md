Resources 
=============================================================



###General Python resources

- Python itself has good documentation and a decent getting started page [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html).
- Python gives a list of good tutorials [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). Many are focused on people with no programming background, but two that seem a bit less introductory are the [Python in 10 minutes](http://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) tutorial, and [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).
- There is a [Coursera course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) running from Jan 9, 2016 through Feb 20, 2016.
- I tend to find it easiest to learn languages with some application in mind, so I learned python using the [Intro to NLP in Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/). Highly recommend as a great way to learn two very useful skills at once!
- Here's a [guide on installing IPython](IPython_install_guide.html).
###More advanced Python resources 

- [Boto, a Python library for MTurk’s API](https://github.com/boto/boto). There is decent (although not perfect) documentation [here](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/mturk.html) and a good tutorial available [here](http://www.toforge.com/2011/04/boto-mturk-tutorial-create-hits/).
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an amazingly easy library for doing machine learning in Python. It is also wonderfully verbosely documented with tons of examples.
- [Kaggle has some tutorials on sklearn](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn/visualization)
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) is a great library for doing natural language processing in Python.  
- [Python client for the CrowdFlower API](https://github.com/peoplepattern/crowdflower).  There’s a tutorial on the [People Pattern blog](http://www.peoplepattern.com/crowdflower-python-client-crowdflower-api/).
- [Seaborn: statistical data visualization in Python](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html)

### Other Resources
- [Tutorial on making videos](video_vimeo_tutorial.html) and uploading them to vimeo

### Artificial Intelligence tutorials and APIs
- [Microsoft's Project Oxford APIs](https://www.projectoxford.ai).  These APIs include functions for computer vision, face recognition, speech recognition and generation. 
- [Google Knowledge Graph Search APIs](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/)
- [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)
- [Probability Tutorial from Peter Norvig](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Probability.ipynb)
- [EM Tutorial from Dirk Hovy](https://github.com/dirkhovy/emtutorial)


### Data sets
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Data from Yahoo! Labs](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l)
- [Pete Skomoroch's delicious data sets](https://delicious.com/pskomoroch/dataset)

### Other Courses about Crowdsourcing 
- [UMich - Human Computation and Crowdsourcing Systems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJki8Kq-uXIjUnLMK4SdQHqlYo1xULTH93gOcjYL6vw/pub?embedded=true)
- [Purdue University - Crowd-Powered Systems](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~aq/695/15sp/)
- [CMU - Crowd Programming](http://www.programthecrowd.com)
- [UT Austin - Crowdsourcing: Theory, Methods, and Applications  ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oiweK0Vvio193DSze9gANzj81XqwjaV3W6uF5pQ9s4M/preview)
