Crowdsourcing and human computation are emerging fields that sit squarely at the intersection of economics and computer science. They examine how people can be used to solve complex tasks that are currently beyond the capabilities of artificial intelligence algorithms. Online marketplaces like [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) and [CrowdFlower](https://crowdflower.com) provide an infrastructure that allows micropayments to be given to people in return for completing human intelligence tasks. This opens up previously unthinkable possibilities like people being used as function calls in software. We will investigate how crowdsourcing can be used for computer science applications like machine learning, next-generation interfaces, and data mining. Beyond these computer science aspects, we will also delve into topics like the sharing economy, prediction markets, how businesses can capitalize on collective intelligence, and the fundamental principles that underlie democracy and other group decision-making processes.

Prerequisites
: [CIS 120](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/) or prior programming experience

Course Readings
: Selections from [The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki](http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki-ebook/dp/B000FCKC3I/)

Grading
: This is a project-based course.  Instead of exams, you will do a series of hands-on assignments and a final project.  

* 9 weekly assignments (5% each)
* Final project (40%)
* In-class presentation: Company Profile (10%)
* Peer grading (5%)

Late day policy
: Everyone can have 5 free late days without penalty.  After you have used your free late days, you will lose 1 point per day (or faction thereof) that your assignment is submitted late.  HW1 wonâ€™t count towards your free late days, since Amazon slowed everyone down.
