Market Research <span class="text-muted">: Written Assignment 2</span> 
=============================================================
You get a break from python this week. Instead, we are taking a step back, looking at the wealth of companies that use crowdsourcing as part of their business. ('wealth' [sense 2, not sense 1](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=wealth&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=). [Word sense disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation) is still an open problem!)

If you haven't already, choose a [presentation date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqm_QKjV_1EkdHdYRU1lOXFncHFxaXVDdTJqZVRuR1E&usp=sharing) and a company. You will need to give a short 5 to 10 minute presentation on your company on your chosen date, answering the following questions:

- What incentives does it offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?

Turn in a short writeup (~ 1 page) answering these questions by <b>Wednesday, September 25</b>. Your presentation slides are due on the day you give your presentation.
