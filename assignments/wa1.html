<h1>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation</h1>

<h2>Written Assignment 1 : Due Wednesday, September 4</h2>

<p>The point of the first assignment is to get to acquainted with Mechanical Turk from the worker's perspective. The crowdsourcing platform allows us, the programmers, to completely anonymize our workforce, and work with humans as though they are function calls (fullfilling every antisocial CS student's dreams). Since, for the rest of the semester, you will be relying on Turkers to complete work for you quickly and accurately, you should take this first assignment as an opportunity to understand your workers and the ways you can help them work best for you. Pay attention to what makes tasks interesting and attractive, how much each task pays, and whether you think the compensation is fair. We will ask you to turn in a short writeup describing your experience.</p>

<p>You should be excited about this assignment! You will actually get <em>paid</em> to do it! For my 50 HITs, I made a full $1.14. That is a far better return than the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=vaso&amp;ei=oBMMUqixB47q0QH-owE">terrible stock</a> which I am holding for no good reason. So go! Have fun!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sign up for MTurk as a worker <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for MTurk as a requester <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">here</a>. You won't use this for this assignment directly, but we want everyone signed up early so we can get you set up with Amazon credits.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose at least 50 assignments to complete. Try to get a sense of the variety of tasks that are available, and the kinds of projects for which Mturk is being used. Once you sign up, you will see that you <em>can</em> complete this assignment by doing 50 google searches, but come on, really? Keep a log to record, for each HIT:</p>

<ul>
<li>Description
<li>How many you did
<li>How much it paid
<li>How long it took you to complete
</ul></li>
<li><p>Provide short answers (a few sentences each) to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What tasks did you do, and how did you pick them?
<li>How much money did you make?
<li>What was your hourly wage per task?
<li>How long did it take you to get paid?
<li>Serveral tools exists for better Turking (e.g. <a href="http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/">Turkopticon</a> and <a href="http://turkernation.com/">TurkerNation</a>). Explore a few of these and give us your thoughts.
