# Crowdsourcing and Human Computation

## Readings:

As assigned readings, we will use selections from Surowiecki's book, as well as various academic papers and articles. See the individual topics on the syllabus for specific readings. Below is the full list of selected academic papers. You will need to choose three to read and summarize as one of your written assignments. If you are interested in a topic and find other relevant papers you would like to use for your assignment, come talk to us about it.

##Resources

Below are some resources which may be interesting or useful throughout the semester. 

["The Wisdom of Crowds" by James Surowiecki](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706/)

Here is a great [blog](http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/) by Panos Ipeirotis from NYU's Stern School of Business about the trials and tribulations of crowdsourcing. 

FAQs about [creating HITs on MTurk](https://requester.mturk.com/help/getting_started.html) and about [MTurk in general](http://aws.amazon.com/mturk/faqs/).

If you need help with python basics, there are [many good tutorials](http://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) online.

Here is a link to the [MTurk API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_OperationsArticle.html) and to [boto](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/mturk.html), the python interface we covered in class. 

Here is a [nice boto tutorial](http://www.toforge.com/2011/04/boto-mturk-tutorial-create-hits/), from which I stole most of the code for the in-class tutorial. You can download the code from the in-class python tutorial [here](slides/tutorial.tar.gz). To run it, you will need to install boto, which is available on [git](https://github.com/boto/boto).

If you want a deeper introduction to EM, here is a [great lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZGTuAkF-Hw&feature=PlayList&p=A89DCFA6ADACE599&index=11) by Andrew Ng at Stanford. Actually, [all of their machine learning lectures](http://see.stanford.edu/see/lecturelist.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1) are available online, and very well delivered.
