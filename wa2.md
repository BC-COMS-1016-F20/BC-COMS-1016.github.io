Market Research <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 2</span> 
=============================================================
This week we will be looking at the wealth of companies that use crowdsourcing as part of their business. ('wealth' [sense 2, not sense 1](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=wealth&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=). [Word sense disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation) is still an open problem!)

This assignment has two deliverables.  
1. Answering [a questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cEkW2h2xwVyKaXriKR7PqroPDjQZE34AKPoRP-lUV5Y/viewform?usp=send_form) about the company or project that you are researching (due 9/10/14).
2. A slideshow and video that you will use for an in-class presentation (due 9/17/14).

This assignment can be done individually or in pairs.

First, please sign up for a [company or project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOcI7BJUQGeG3Pb3oZPRqfTt2JYwRnjnTqImex9qsSQ/edit#gid=209977841).  If there’s a company that you’d like to research that isn’t on the list, you are welcome to ask the instructor or the TA to ask if it is OK.  Second, please choose a [presentation date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOcI7BJUQGeG3Pb3oZPRqfTt2JYwRnjnTqImex9qsSQ/edit#gid=0).

You should independently research the company, and then [fill in your answers about it in this questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cEkW2h2xwVyKaXriKR7PqroPDjQZE34AKPoRP-lUV5Y/viewform?usp=send_form).  Your short answers to these questions by <b>Wednesday, September 10</b>. 

You will record a short 5 to 7 minute video presentation about your company and present it in class on the date that you choose.  You must record the video.  For the in-class presentation, you can either play the recording and answer questions afterwards, or you can give a live presentation.  Your presentation should address the following questions:

- What incentives does it offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?
- Are there any controversies about the company?

Your presentation video is due <b>Wednesday, September 17</b>.
