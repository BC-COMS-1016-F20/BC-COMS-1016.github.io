# Policies

### Disclaimer
These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staff.

All times listed on the course webpage are in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

### Support
You are not alone in this course; the course staff
are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For questions, use [Piazza](piazza.com/columbia/fall2020/comsbc1016). We will also hold virtual office hours for real-time discussions. 

The Barnard CS help room is a great resources as well. We have listed their times on our [Office Hours page](http://coms1016.barnard.edu/office-hours.html#barnard-cs-help-room). The Zoom link is posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kcm2u88of5p1hz?cid=9). 

### Prerequisites
BC COMS 1016 has no prerequisites. The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics or computer science courses. Students with some prior experience in either statistics or computing are welcome to enroll and will find much of interest due to the innovative nature of the course. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course.

### Materials
The main text is a free online textbook called [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/). This textbook was created by instructors of [data8](data8.org), a popular course at Berkeley. Our course is adopted from data8.

The computing platform for the course is hosted at [http://jupyterhub.coms1016.barnard.edu/](http://jupyterhub.coms1016.barnard.edu/).
You will login using your Barnard/Columbia credentials.
Materials for all homeworks, projects, and labs will be distributed on the course schedule page. 

### Homework and Projects
Homework assignments are a required part of the course. They will be released on Mondays and Thursdays, and due on Thursdays and Sundays. Each student must submit each homework independently, but you are encouraged to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the "Learning Cooperatively" section below.

Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so a series of projects involving real data are a required part of the course. On each project, you may work with a single partner. Both partners will receive the same score.

#### Late days
To account for issues that arise in these uncertain times, each student has **10 late** days for the homeworks and projects. However, you can only use at most **2 late** days per assignment. 

### Labs
There are two labs a week.
Both weekly labs will be due by the Friday night (11:59pm) after the lab. 
***todo: add ***

There are no late day for the labs
