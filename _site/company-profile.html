<b>Who were the founders?</b> Ted D'Cruz-Young <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> July 2012 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not really. I young hippie do-gooder kind of founder who wanted to come up with an organization to promote eating healthy, local food and reduce food waste. The founder also started a marketing agency called Ideocracy. <br />

<b>What services does MealKu provide?</b> Mealku is basically a middleman that helps its members exchange food. Since there is no cost to receiving food, Mealku tracks points so that members have to put into the co-op (usually by providing food, but also by providing reviews and being active on the site) in order to receive food from the co-op. It also provides bicycle deliverymen and storage containers to transport the food from cook to consumer. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Fast food deliver/take-out. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Health- and environment-conscious urban people. They say the goal is to make healthy food affordable, but it looks like you need a decent amount of cooking time and space in order to cook for other people, so I would imagine that most of the users are middle class. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The users and the contributors are the same crowd. You have to provide food in order to receive food. <br />

<b>How does MealKu incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> People don't join unless they want to provide food. It is as much a community of hippie foodies as it is a way of getting free meals. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does MealKu ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Kitchen inspections, user reviews, and peer pressure. <br />


	<b>If MealKu uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Users can rate the meals they receive, both using a star system over several criteria (food quality, portion size, etc) and by leaving free form comments. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> The gov't doesn't currently regulate food exchanges that are not monetary. Mealku makes an effort to check that the cooks' kitchens are not cesspools of waste, but it mostly operates on the trust system. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> Roughly equal numbers <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> You only get points if others sign up to receive your food, and you can't receive food if you don't have points, so the crowd can end up filtering out the people who are making poor contributions. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Users sign up, pay a monthly fee to cover deliver and packaging. Then they post meals they intend to cook (about 3 days before they intend to do so). If people sign up to receive those meals (paying points to do so) then the cook prepares them as promised, a Mealku delivery biker comes to their house with to pick up the packaged food, and brings it to the person who ordered it. The person who ordered can review the cook online afterward. The cook receives points for having provided food. <br />

<b>What is the scale of MealKu in terms of users?</b> ~1500 <br />

<b>What is the scale of MealKu in terms of dollars?</b> N/A <br />

<b>If MealKu were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Not very well. It depends on a local, trust-based community. It could probably scale well to many local organizations in many different cities, like a franchise model. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does MealKu generate revenue?</b> They don't. It is a co-op, so they just need to stay afloat. <br />

</div>


<b>Who were the founders?</b> Ben Kaufman <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2009 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Quirky arose when the founder's first business attempts at 18 years old failed miserably. He later decided that he could make invention and entrepreneurship more accessible by providing the platform for manufacturing, pricing, and sale - bringing the ideas of others to life. <br />

<b>What services does Quirky provide?</b> For inventors, they pay for the genius of the crowd - they take your idea, let other people vote to determine the best, use a crowd of experts to select one each week for manufacture, then use non-experts to determine price points and decide design questions. Their employees manufacture it. <p>For consumers, they sell devices that improve life in some way - modular power strips solve the problem of large plug-ins blocking other ports, internet-connected piggy banks make saving money trackable and fun, and a plethora of cord and desk organizers, among many others. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It's a smaller-scale incubator, where the inventor isn't expected to have technical skills or marketing prowess. Quirky takes in an idea, uses people to evaluate its merit, then makes and sells it based on price points provided by the crowd. <p>What makes Quirky unique is that it pays people to be influencers rather than simply inventors - no other site incorporates the crowd so well. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Anyone, from a suburban mom to a seasoned patent-holder, could pitch an idea for an invention - their bare minimum is a one-sentence description, not a technical write-up or elevator pitch. Anyone, anywhere, can influence the inventions by deciding details on it or voting for the highest-quality ideas. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> There are no limitations or criteria preventing anyone from contributing, in an inventor or influencer role. In practice, inventors seem to be younger people who have encountered a problem repeatedly. There is no data released on influencers. <br />

<b>How does Quirky incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The company pays inventors - the people who pitch the original idea - 4.2% of the revenue of the product, assuming the product is manufactured and sold. It is easier to be an influencer; you can weigh in on design and price details of a product that is guaranteed to be rolled out, though of course your contribution is much less. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Quirky ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Interestingly, at Quirky the crowd regulates itself via a voting system for ideas. However, there is involvement from experts (retailers, manufacturers, marketers) when, each Thursday night, the company meets and picks the next idea to manufacture. People weigh in on design concerns, and at the end of the night, the physical crowd (mixed between experts and non-experts) votes on whether or not they will manufacture something. If more than half of the crowd votes yes, the founder has committed to moving it to production. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Typically, the government would protect the interests of investors by providing some type of intellectual property right. Quirky does not give credit to investors, but rather purchases the rights to an idea if they decide to use it, passing a share of the revenue along to the investor. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Contributions are aggregated via a simple majority. The most votes for non-quantitative options and the simple mean for quantitative options determine design specifications and prices, even product names. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service does not seem to be advertised on any external sites, only on the shopping portal itself. If you decide to invent, you are brought to a form to describe your idea. Once that is completed, influencers can vote to indicate their favorite design ideas. Then the Quirky team decides whether or not they will produce it, at which point influencers can vote for design specifications, name, prices, etc. <p>Both inventors and influencers receive a fraction of the revenue if Quirky decides to produce it. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Quirky in terms of users?</b> Quirky has nearly one million contributors, and has released 344 products since 2009. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Quirky in terms of dollars?</b> Quirky has projected $100 million in earnings in 2014. <br />

<b>If Quirky were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> It would likely work better the larger the crowd becomes. There would be more ideas proposed, and, assuming patient and thorough voters, the best would rise to the top, where a larger crowd would ensure better price points, names, and color choices. The quality would improve and Quirky would likely benefit from an even larger customer base. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Quirky generate revenue?</b> The company sells the devices after they are pitched, assessed, priced, and designed by the crowd. Quirky manufactures the devices, sometimes for sale on their website, sometimes in partnership with retail giants like Home Depot. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> I want to work for them! In a real, employee-type-way, not as an influencer. Being an inventor would be cool too. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> April 2010 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> The founder, Anthony Goldbloom won an essay contest with The Economist and did a three month internship in the Finance and Economics Section. Here, he was writing about big data and in the process came up with the idea behind Kaggle. After the internship he taught himself to code at night and eventually created Kaggle 1.0. <br />

<b>What services does Kaggle provide?</b> Kaggle offers a a framework for the competition, consulting service for the host to prepare the data and the description of the problem, anonymize the data, and integrate the winning model into their operations. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It replaces tech consulting firms since through this platform, even companies without internal data science teams can come up with predictive models for the problems they had. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Researchers and organizations like NASA, Microsoft, Heritage Provider Network use this service. An example would be NASA's cosmological image analysis competition for mapping dark matter. Here, the participants were provided with images of 100,000 galaxy and star pairs, then based on the tiny distortions in the images, they were to provide an estimate for the ellipticity for each galaxy. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Students and data scientists from over 100 countries and 200 universities. <br />

<b>How does Kaggle incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Prize money and test data are some incentives. Some people use Kaggle to meet, learn, network and collaborate with experts from related fields. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Kaggle ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> n some senses, the service provided is self-regulated in terms of quality. Since the incentivize structure is set up as a competition, there would really be no point in entering the competition if you aren't going to make an honest attempt at the problem. It is technically possible that all the data scientists could collude, submit bogus solutions, and split the prize amongst themselves without doing any real work, but considering a large part of the incentive structure has to do with the challenge and glory of the competitions, this is not very likely. <br />


	<b>If Kaggle uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Kaggle users are allocated points for their performance in competitions. The overall user rankings are then shown on their website. Kaggle also separates its users into 3 tiers - novice, Kaggler, and master. Each tier is demarcated by a different color profile. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Kaggle presents problems in competition form, so many teams compete against one another to come up with the best solution to the problem. Although the teams are competing against one another, Kaggle is a way for some of the top minds to collaborate with others from all over the world, and the forum on Kaggle provides a great way for knowledge- and idea-sharing to take place. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> When a company/institution has a predictive data problem they would like solved, they can create a simplified (or not) version of the problem and create a competition for it, offering a prize of their choosing for the winner. The competition is then posted on the competition board on Kaggle, where the contributors (Kagglers) can choose to tackle the problem by forming teams and signing up for the competition. Each team's ranking is tracked in real-time throughout the duration of the competition, and when the time for the competition is up, the winning team gets awarded whatever prize was offered, and each user is rewarded his/her respective points for completing the competition. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kaggle in terms of users?</b> 200,000 data scientists (contributors); at any time, there will be around 10-15 competitions (hosted by users) <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kaggle in terms of dollars?</b> Up to $3 million in prize money <br />

<b>If Kaggle were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Our initial thought was that, because a decent proportion of the Kagglers are Ph.D.'s, there would be an upper limit to the number of Kagglers that could be drawn in join these competitions. However, upon further research, one article revealed that the typical competition winner on Kaggle is self-taught. With this in mind, and given the potential generous size of the prizes (up to $300 an hour) and the fun aspect of the competitions, we feel that Kaggle's ability to attract the necessary talent to solve these problems would scale up quite well without sacrificing quality of the data scientists. Similarly, given the rise of big data and the associated need for data analysis, we feel that the number of companies and institutions funding these projects, and hence the incentive scheme, would similarly scale up well (more projects, more available prize money). Another point to make is that a lot of the scientists are incentivized by the challenge and the glory Kaggle presents (as opposed to the money), all of which would remain (if not intensify) if Kaggle were to scale up.None that we are aware of <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Kaggle generate revenue?</b> Kaggle charges a fixed fee to those hosting the competitions and also gets a proportion of prize money. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 1997 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Supposedly, Hastings came up with the idea for Netflix when he was charged $40 for late fees on a very late copy of Apollo 13. <p>(**ppt&#58; Hastings got charged $40 for late fees - wasn't happy **) <br />

<b>What services does Netflix provide?</b> Internet video streaming and disc rental. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> They started with only an online disc rental service, which was pay per rental. After this, they added a subscription based service. From there, they drop the pay per rental and progressed to the internet streaming later on. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> People of all ages, including families and students will use this in lieu of going to their local rental movie place (which are all but nonexistent anymore). I've personally used this service to catch up on old TV series and watch movies that I either haven't seen before, or wanted to watch on a whim, opposed to planning a whole movie night and segmenting time to go and pick up a movie from BlockBuster or a RedBox. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The contributers of the service are the same people who purchase subscriptions to Netflix and watch the movies and TV shows <br />

<b>How does Netflix incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> They are incentived not explicitly, but rather implicity by the results of the contributions. People's recommendations help rank what movies they enjoy, and help Netflix give suggestions for movies or shows they would probably like to see. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Netflix ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Controversially, they have purchased highways of bandwidth, partnering with certain internet providers, so that their streaming service won't be interrupted or hampered. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> They are aggragated according to an algorithm. This algorithm has changed a lot in recent years, and Netflix even offered a $1,000,000 prize to a person/team who could up with an algorithm that beats their current one by 10% for guessing what TV shows and movies people would watch. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is advertised heavily through internet ads, commercial TV ads, as well as word of mouth. Contributors contribute by rating a movie or show on a 5 star system through the site, prompted after they watch it. Users in the end get an aggregation from other users of the popularity of certain movies and how that might relate to their preferences. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Netflix in terms of users?</b> On the order of 50 million users <br />

<b>What is the scale of Netflix in terms of dollars?</b> The operating income is $228 million where the total assets are $5.4 billion. <br />

<b>If Netflix were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Netflix is primarily an English site, showing English movies, with the option of other languages subtitles as well as some small selection of foreign movies. Therefore, to scale up by 10 times, to ~500 million users, would hit the limit of English speakers of the world (currently ~430 million), so they would be limited by that factor. Their incentive scheme is already scaled to such a high number, that I don't believe it needs scaling, although the quality and aggregation model might need to adapt to more worldwide users, especially where people come from different cultures, even if speaking English, and consider how it may affect their contributions. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Publicly traded company <br />

<b>How does Netflix generate revenue?</b> They generate revenue through the subscriptions of their customers. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Stack Overflow was created as a crowdsourced alternative to earlier Q&amp;A sites like Experts Exchange. Interestingly enough, the name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, founder Atwood's popular programming blog. As the primary purpose of the site was to help programmers solve and help each other with mainly technical programming issues, the terms 'stack' and 'overflow' can be put together to loosely mirror 'memory overflow' in meaning! <br />

<b>What services does Stack Overflow provide?</b> The main purpose of stack overflow is to provide a forum for the online programming community to get together and discuss technical aspects across a wide range of programming languages and structures in an interactive and open Q&amp;A format. The site has users who post both queries and answers and moderators who monitor postings and bulletins. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Stack Overflow is used primarily by programmers working in nearly every kind of possible programming language or environment to troubleshoot problems, offer solutions to other problems in the community and to participate in finding answers in the field of computer science and programming. Each user first logs in with a free account and can then post queries that need answering and can provide working solutions and explanations to other ongoing query resolutions. Active members earn reputation points which make their answers more reputable. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The users are the contributors. <br />

<b>How does Stack Overflow incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> By answering questions and getting solutions voted up by other community members on the site, contributors are encouraged to use Stack Overflow and improve their online reputation and coding profile. Special badges and achievements on the site profile can be unlocked, which leads to a very highly viewed profile that can be linked or referred to on other sites on the internet. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Stack Overflow ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> As the website is all about 'finding answers' the quality of the answers is collectively assessed by the 'crowd' of users actively participating in the community, through vote ups or vote downs and through reputation points. There are moderators who routinely run searches through threads to check for duplicated questions/old unanswered questions etc, but majority of quality control is user judged. <br />


	<b>If Stack Overflow uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Yes, users earn reputation points for their Stack Overflow account profiles (which show up on each question posted or answered). This raises the repute of high point-earners, making their answers much more reliable than beginners. There are also special badges and achievements which can be unlocked and added to the profile. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> Roughly equal numbers <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Multiple users can provide answers to the same question/query. However, by the process of voting up the most relevant/accurate/efficient answer, the website crowdsources the process of ranking questions. All answers are shown by default, but higher voted up answers are shown first. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> They don't delete repetitive posts, so there are a lot of keywords on the site, leading to it being at the top of search engine hits. Unanswered questions are listed under a tab on the homepage of the site, making it easy for people to answer questions. Contributors and users are the same people, and they answer and ask questions for the goal of sharing information.<p> <br />

<b>What is the scale of Stack Overflow in terms of users?</b> In 2012 they had over 175,000 users, the global	site ranking is currently 49 and its 51 in the US. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Stack Overflow in terms of dollars?</b> Their revenue is not listed publicly because it is a privately held company. <br />

<b>If Stack Overflow were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think the incentive scheme would scale well, as long as Stack Overflow Careers could grow accordingly. With more users the quality would be even better, because there would be more feedback on the quality of the questions and answers. The only problem might be if there were not a balanced amount of questions and people answering questions.<p> <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held website <br />

<b>How does Stack Overflow generate revenue?</b> Stack Overflow is a part of Stack Exchange which is an online package framework for a multitude of websites and they all generate revenue through ad listings on the website in strategic locations on the page - such as between questions and answers and next to question lists. In addition, Stack Overflow displays job positions and career options from external partner companies (mostly in the computer programming sector) which also add to the total revenue stream. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Nate Silver <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> March 7, 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> The website was launched and quickly gained prominence during the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. 538 (at the time consisting of only founder Nate Silver) was unique in its approach to predicting the outcomes of primary elections, using a model based mainly on demographic information and past results in other states, rather than polls, to predict outcomes. In many cases, this model was more accurate than the traditional poll-based model, garnering significant attention for the site throughout the election cycle and beyond. <br />

<b>What services does FiveThirtyEight (538) provide?</b> The site produces statistical analysis and blog content covering a wide range of subject matter. Most prominently, the site produces statistically modeled predictions for upcoming elections using polls published by other outlets and various other data. Other content categories include Sports, Economics, Science, and Life. In a typical post, a data-driven approach is taken to providing insight into a particular topic. For example, one of today's main features is America's Best Burrito, the last of a series of articles in which burrito shops from across the country (chosen based on Yelp data and expert opinions) have been scored using a prescribed methodology and a winner picked using a bracket-style competition. The feature focuses not only on burritos, but also on the reliability and usefulness of crowdsourced data found on sites like Yelp. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> As a poll aggregator, 538 is similar to many services before it, including such companies as Real Clear Politics and the Princeton Election Consortium. Unlike these sites, 538 offers significant non-political content on top of its poll aggregation services. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> The service is meant for readers of all backgrounds who are seeking interesting and new insights into topics with which they are already familiar. The website is well designed, visually appealing, and easy to use. Much of the content is interactive, with infographics and charts which are click-able and customizable. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Contributors to 538 are its data sources and the site's staff of writers and data analysts. Data sources include various polls published by other (sometimes competing) publications. 538 has received criticism for its lack of transparency about the way in which its gathered polling data is used in its models. <br />

<b>How does FiveThirtyEight (538) incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> FiveThirtyEight collects data by paying for it or gathering it from its publication on other sites. Thus, not all contributors to 538 necessarily do so willingly or knowingly. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does FiveThirtyEight (538) ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> When polling, FiveThirtyEight uses large sampling pools and then applies several mathematical adjustments to these sampling pools to ensure the accuracy of its numbers. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> FiveThirtyEight accumulates polling data from several polls and then calculates an adjusted score based on these parameters (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pollster-ratings-v40-methodology/). <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> FiveThirtyEight uses other polls and does not directly crowdsource. <br />

<b>What is the scale of FiveThirtyEight (538) in terms of users?</b> The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported. <br />

<b>What is the scale of FiveThirtyEight (538) in terms of dollars?</b> The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported. <br />

<b>If FiveThirtyEight (538) were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Scaling 538 to 10 or 100 times its size would not largely affect the business model. The company would require more employees to run statistical analyses, but because 538 compiles data rather than collects it, the business model would not be as other companies' who depend on data collection. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does FiveThirtyEight (538) generate revenue?</b> FiveThirtyEight generates revenue by selling advertisements on its webpage. In the past, revenue was also generated by licensing content to be published elsewhere, notable by the New York Times from 2010 to 2013. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> 538 was not a perfect match for many of these questions because it uses data differently than many other consumer data-dependent companies. 538 does not directly generate revenue from its customers and thus cares less about their spending behavior. Obviously, 538 wants to increase its number of readers, but 538 has access to less consumer data because there are no transactions between 538 and its customers. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jared Heyman, Jessica Greenwalt, and Leonardo Setyano <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> April 2013 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> From the website&#58; After nearly three frustrating years, Carly was desperate for answers. She was clearly suffering from a serious medical condition, but nearly two dozen doctors, countless medical tests and over $100,000 in medical bills still could not tell her what was wrong. Carly had once been a vibrant, healthy teenager, but now she could barely get out of bed. Her symptoms and the emotional stress were pushing her and her family to the breaking point.<p>Finally, after a rare opportunity to consult with a top-notch interdisciplinary team of medical experts from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Carly received an answer&#58; Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) - a rare genetic mutation found in just one of every 15,000 people. Even more astounding, the treatment of Carly's condition involved a simple hormone patch, which effectively eliminated all of her symptoms in less than one month.<p>Prior to her diagnosis, Carly was starting to wonder whether her life was already over. Today, Carly is fully recovered, with a new family of her own, and she is actively achieving all of her personal and professional goals.<p>Carly's medical mystery took nearly three years, two dozen doctors, and more than $100,00 in medical bills to diagnose.Her case was eventually solved after she had a rare opportunity to meet with a large, interdisciplinary team of top-notch medical experts - who all collaborated and worked together, and remained focused on the case for as long as it took to reach a consensus-based diagnosis.Thus, her brother, Jared Heyman, was inspired to start CrowdMed. <br />

<b>What services does CrowdMed provide?</b> CrowdMed uses crowdsourcing and patented prediction market technology to diagnose rare conditions that doctors could easily miss, as well as offering “second opinions” to patients who may be unsure of the accuracy of their stated diagnosis. CrowdMed's patented technology uses the collective knowledge, intelligence, and unbiased opinions of thousands of “Medical Detectives” to present an accurate list of a patient's most probably diagnoses, sometimes in a matter of hours. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> This service doesn't really replace the practice of health specialists and online health forums, but it does help in finding solutions faster and easier. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Rip Heminway did a lot of running, soccer, back-country skiing, and white water kayaking. However, he started losing mobility and getting chronic pain. He said that a specialist would give him a list of different htings they think it might be, but never any kind of concrete clarity around what the problem was. He ended up spending thousands of dollars on specialists, blood tests, lab results, and the like. When he got his report from CrowdMed, he got a whole series of diagnoses which gave him a great foundation to work from. CrowdMed provided him to find succinct information. He is now pain-free and fully functional. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> While most of the Medical Detectives are active in medicine, others might not be doctors but do have first-hand experience with specific medical conditions. CrowdMed has proven that many kinds of people can help solve medical mysteries - including researchers, students, and even former patients.<p> <br />

<b>How does CrowdMed incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> CrowdMed uses a point-based system to track Medical Detective performance and reward our community appropriately. By maximizing their point earnings, Medical Detectives can improve their ranking and reputation, earn the recognition of their peers, and even earn cash compensation offered by patients. Most importantly, Medical Detectives help patients get their lives back, which provides a sense of personal satisfaction in itself. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does CrowdMed ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> CrowdMed uses a patented prediction market algorithm to assign probabilities to each diagnostic or solution suggestion based upon our Medical Detectives' background and behavior. They look for the most probable solutions, not just the most popular ones.<p>CrowdMed has devoted several years to develop patented prediction market methods to filter out any noise from all the input, to produce a report that highlights the top diagnostic and solution suggestions from the highest ranked Medical Detectives, which have the most confidence within the community.<p>Medical Detectives assign points to indicate their confidence in the suggestions offered to your case - a key component to the success and accuracy of the service. The points system requires people to prove their confidence, rather than just assume they're correct.<p> <br />


	<b>If CrowdMed uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Cases are active for 30 days unless extended by the patient. At the end of this period, patients are asked to review the results with their physician and select the best diagnostic and solution suggestions. Medical Detectives who contributed to these suggestions are awarded points, status, and even cash compensation from those patients offering it - but the greatest reward for most of our Medical Detectives is knowing they've helped people get their lives back.<p>“Detective Rating System”. This system assigns a score to each Medical Detective on a 1-10 scale, which is expressed as their DetectiveRating (e.g., DR6). Inspired by Google's PageRank system, our DetectiveRating system provides a variable opinion weighting and special privileges to those Medical Detectives who perform the best on our site. For example, only DR6's and above can assign points on diagnostic and solution suggestions on cases offering cash compensation, thus influencing their probability rankings. Note, a peer rating from a DR8 carries twice as much weight as one from a DR4.<p><p> <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Cases are active for 30 days. When a case is posted, Medical Detectives provide well-researched and evidence-based diagnostic suggestions for patients to confirm with their doctors by posting them to the case. At the end of this process, contributions are aggregated, and the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solution,along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> When a case is posted, Medical Detectives have the chance to provide input for the case. Medical Detectives may also use chat and discussion features to ask questions, request additional details, and discuss your case. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solutions, along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community. <br />

<b>What is the scale of CrowdMed in terms of users?</b> Information not available. Called the office and they said they could not disclose information not on the website. <br />

<b>What is the scale of CrowdMed in terms of dollars?</b> In 2013 they received $1.1 million in seed funding. <br />

<b>If CrowdMed were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> If the company were to scale up to 10 or 100 times its current size, I think that its business model would still work. The current quality/aggregation model would work even for bigger sizes; however, there may possibly be a need to better categorize cases if the number of cases significantly increases in order to help Medical Detectives better find the cases they would most likely be familiar with. The reputation model of the Medical Detectives may also change to put more emphasis on the professional credentials of the Detectives in addition to their contribution to the site. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does CrowdMed generate revenue?</b> In terms of revenue, the company is currently charging a 10 percent commission on all cash rewards offered by patients for accurate diagnoses. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> I think that this company has a great idea; I'm surprised that there are no other companies just like it. CrowdMed does a great job providing information to those who may not have access to it; however, the quality of the obtained information must be carefully assessed. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Matt Rutledge <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> Woot was founded on July 12, 2004, but shirt.woot was started until July 2007 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Woot began in 2004, but quickly branched into it's first sub-site wine.woot, which offers daily deals on wine that they will ship to your home.  Then came shirt.woot, which utilized the user voting schema.  After branching off into even more sub-sites (kids.woot, deals.woot, computers.woot, tools.woot, electronics.woot, etc.) woot was acquired in 2010 by Amazon for an estimated $110,000,000. <br />

<b>What services does Woot (shirt.woot specifically) provide?</b> It is an Internet retailer.  It provides a community of artists and consumers, and allows amateur artists to release works to be reviewed by the community. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> In my personal experience, I subscribe to the email listserv, which sends out the one deal per day.  If I like the design, then I have a limited time to buy the shirt before it either goes up in price, or runs out of stock.<p>Another use one might have would be that of an amateur artist.  As an artist, you can submit designs for free.  Have them be reviewed and commented on by peers in the community.  And if you win, you can garnish $1000 plus $2 per shirt sold after the first day. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Amateur artists submit designs for the weekly derby, and professional artists submit designs to shirt.woot's staff picks.  T-shirt buyers and artists vote on designs to decide what eventually gets printed and sold on the site. <br />

<b>How does Woot (shirt.woot specifically) incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Artists are motivated by the love of art, $1,000 for a top 3 position along with $2 for every unit sold after the first day.  Users are incentivized by voting for shirts that they would like to see win, printed, and delivered to their door for a cheap price. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Woot (shirt.woot specifically) ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> They have individuals vote on which t-shirts they want -- so the ones sold are the ones most demanded by the consumers. <p>There are also staff picks where shirt.woot employees select designs to be printed outside of the derby. <br />


	<b>If Woot (shirt.woot specifically) uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> The winners, whose shirts are sold at a discount, are determined via votes. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> The weekly derby allows artists to submit designs for a 1 week period during which other artists and users will vote on designs.  At the end of the week three designs are called the winners, and receive $1,000 + $2 per shirt sold after the first day. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Attract artists to submit designs to the curated store or weekly derby through the financial incentives described above. Contributors can either submit their t-shirt designs or vote on the designs they like best. If a designer is in the top 3 in voting, he will get paid $1000 the first day and $2 for every shirt sold the day after. The voters will get to purchase the t-shirts that won as well. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Woot (shirt.woot specifically) in terms of users?</b> This information is not readily available. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Woot (shirt.woot specifically) in terms of dollars?</b> This information is not readily available, as it's parent company Woot was bought by Amazon in 2010 for 110 million. However, it's parent company, Woot, had a $164 million dollars in revenue in 2008. <br />

<b>If Woot (shirt.woot specifically) were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The incentive scheme would scale well because you could raise the amount paid to artists to attract better quality artists. The quality/aggregation model would also be ok because the shirts are picked by users and the staff -- so more users would automatically mean a more robust aggregation model. If the service were to scale to 100 times size in terms of orders, fast distribution of the t-shirts to users might be an issue without a large enough staff to handle orders, generate t-shirts, and monitor the supply chain. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Publicly traded company <br />

<b>How does Woot (shirt.woot specifically) generate revenue?</b> It garners profit from the t-shirts sold. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> On select days woot will forgoe the One day, one deal mantra for a woot-off where deals are set with a fixed volume, and when all units are gone, another deal is put up within minutes.  The users are shown a progress bar, but no specifics on the amount of units left in stock. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Matt Flannery and Jessica Jackley <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> October 2005 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Kiva was started by the couple Jessica Jackley and Matt Flannery. A lecture by Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, was a call to tap into the power of micro lending. They spearheaded Kiva with entrepreneurs in Kenya, who struggled to get past the lack-of-captial hump. The company's name means 'unity' in Swahili. <br />

<b>What services does Kiva provide?</b> They provide a service to local entrepreneurs, field partners, and individual lenders. Their 'social service' is provide entrepreneurs with a platform to accumulate funding. Kiva field partners--who can be microfinance institutions, nonprofits, schools, and social businesses--upload information about entrepreneurs onto Kiva. The field partners handle the disbursement of the funds raised on Kiva to the entrepreneur, who will pay them back with interest in time. Individual lenders are provided a simple, nearly net-zero way to support social projects--the money they contribute to entrepreneurs is paid back as Kiva credit to give to a new loan. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Kiva is an revolutionary add-on to typical microfinancing efforts. Not only does it organize and validate the loans disbursed by microfinance institutions, Kiva enables other organizations to become established microfinancers. This includes schools, non profits, and social enterprises, who all interface with a wealth of worthy entrepreneurs.<p>It 'recycles' loan money by crowdsourcing. Small donations by lenders accumulate into loans that the field partners can disburse. The entrepreneur still gets their funding, the field partner collects the same interest on the loan as usual, but the lender gets paid back in credit and the money can be reused more efficiently.<p> <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> As a lender (an average person browsing the internet to do social good), you 1)Sign up as a kiva lender, 2)Browse borrower profiles and choose someone to lend to 3)Get paid back in Kiva credit and start again @ <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Based on a January 31, 2013, survey by Kiva (“Kiva Lender Demographics for Kiva Field Partners”), Kiva lenders are 2/3 female and 1/3 male. About 67% of lenders are 35 or older, while about 20% of lenders are 25 - 34 years old. Over 60% of Kiva lenders have a college degree. Approximately 60% of Kiva lenders live in the United States. The rankings by total amount lent per country are as follows&#58; United States (49.96%), Western Europe (14.33%), Canada (6.64%), Australia (3.05%), Asia Pacific (1.71%), Middle East / North Africa (0.34%), Central America / Caribbean (0.22%), South America (0.13%), Central and South Asia (0.09%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (0.05%). <br />

<b>How does Kiva incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> As stated in the above report, these are the most common motivations for people who lend on Kiva&#58;<p>● A method of helping other people. <p>● A way to share their personal good fortune with others. <p>● A way to help an individual improve their social and economic standing. <p>● A window to the world, allowing a lender to become exposed to different people and cultures. <p>● A way to connect with, or give back to, a region where they have traveled or lived. <p>● A way for a lender to help an individual who shares common characteristics to themselves (age, gender, family size/structure, profession, etc.). <p>Additionally, Kiva often releases timed incentives such as, “Donate in the next two days and have your donation matched,” to further encourage lending activity. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Kiva ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> They review profiles of potential borrowers before posting them as eligible to receive a loan. This is a good filtration system to keep the projects listed social impact-guaranteed. <br />


	<b>If Kiva uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> They allow individual lenders to join Lending Teams, which give towards different loans as a group. Kiva puts up a Leaderboard for Lending Teams, which displays top giver and how much they've giving total. Currently, I see Kiva Christians and Carnegie Mellon on the Leaderboard. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Many countries regulate the microfinance industry to prevent fraud, protect consumers, and stabilize financial markets. Regulations change from country to country; for example, the Reserve Bank of India requires that loans made to non-government microfinance institutions have a minimum term of 3 years. Kiva has found ways to work within these regulations by holding on to repaid loans for 3 years before sending repayments back to lenders. Other countries, such as Ecuador, impose interest rate caps and/or extra taxes on internationally-funded microfinance organizations; these regulations directly impact Kiva's field partners, who must find ways to comply. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> An international network of 274 (as of September 8, 2014) microfinance organizations screens borrowers, posts loan requests to Kiva, disburses loans to borrowers, and collects repayments from borrowers. When a lender makes a loan, Kiva delivers the funds to the local Field Partner, who then takes charge of loan administration.<p> <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Kiva advertises 4 simple steps for lenders&#58; 1)choose a borrower 2)make a loan 3)get repaid 4)repeat! The contributors give in step <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kiva in terms of users?</b> As of September 8, 2014, there are 1,219,715 active lenders on Kiva who have funded 1,409,460 borrowers. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kiva in terms of dollars?</b> As of September 8, 2014, there has been $607,594,600 made in loans. <br />

<b>If Kiva were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Yes, The incentive--your money is paid back to you to give again--will always be a component of the Kiva model, even at a huge scale. The quality of the user experience could go down, if  it becomes impossibly hard to search for a great loan and some entrepreneurs never receive funds. (The amount of lender) * (the average amount of money they give) must always be nearly equal to the total amount of money that all loans on Kiva are asking for. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does Kiva generate revenue?</b> Kiva is entirely dependent upon donations. For every loan they make, lenders are encouraged to donate an additional few dollars directly to Kiva&#58; “The majority of Kiva donations are provided by our lenders, who 'tip' us on top of the loans they make to borrowers. … A large majority of the rest of our donation income is provided by foundations, who encourage us to create innovative programs to serve the poor more effectively (e.g. Google.org funding of Kiva Labs).” <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> I think they're wonderful. I'm very curious who their first supporters were, because they have a web interface that's top of the line and obviously required some serious initial investments. There have been a few corrupt field partners, and the model they present isn't entirely honest (they distribute funds to the borrower before publicly posting their profile), but they get the job of microfinancing done with more efficiency and less uncertainty than has traditionally been seen. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Uri Levine, Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not particularly, but according to the About page on Waze's website, the idea for the company came from Ehud Shabtai because he was poor at navigating his way to places, and when given a GPS system, he had ideas about how to improve it. <br />

<b>What services does Waze provide?</b> GPS and turn-by-turn directions <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It enhances the accuracy of estimating travel times and traffic information, and other road information (such as speed traps, construction, etc.) <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> The service can really be used by anyone who is trying to navigate from one place to another, and is not sure how to get there, or what the best route is. I have used Waze in the past and have found it to be great, with the traffic data being accurate and the interfacing being nice and very easy to use. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone can contribute to the services, and usually the users themselves are the contributors <br />

<b>How does Waze incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Waze incentivizes contributors by having a social, game-like feature, where users earn points whenever they contribute road information, and as they accumulate points, their ranking in the Waze community increases. However, there does not seem to be a reward for accumulating points, besides validating your contributions to Waze. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Waze ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Waze relies on the users to ensure the quality of the service – if road or traffic information is incorrect, Waze hopes that users will correct this within the app. For example, Wazers can add the presence of a speed trap on a road, but if a user finds that this speed trap is no longer there, Waze asks the user to update this information in the app. <br />


	<b>If Waze uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Waze's point system serves as the reputation system for the app. The more you contribute, the more points you get, and higher your rank within the Waze community. The point system is quite robust, and the method by which points are assigned can be found here https://wiki.waze.com/wiki/Your_Rank_and_Points#The_Table_of_Points<p> <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Waze has very complicated algorithms to aggregate the contributions, part of which depends on the points that the contributor has. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The contributors contribute by simply driving on the road with the Waze app open. If they run into traffic or notice anything noteworthy on the road (construction, police, an accident, etc.) they can update the map with this information in a hands-free method. This gives the users a real-time map of their surroundings, which ideally has the most accurate traffic and road information available. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Waze in terms of users?</b> According to Yahoo, there were nearly 50 million Waze users as of June 2013. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Waze in terms of dollars?</b> Waze was bought by Google for $1.1 billion but hardly generates revenues. They're revenue is not publicized, but it is known that it is less than $71 million. <br />

<b>If Waze were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I believe that for Waze, the more users the better. More users means more contributors, and more contributors means more accurate information on Waze in terms of traffic and road information. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Waze generate revenue?</b> Waze has a location based advertising system that they launched in October 2012, which provided a source of revenue. There are also sources that say that they sell traffic data to companies such as Apple, which is trying to improve its Maps application. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> N/A <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2000 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> It was founded with only $1000 and was originally a simple community of artists. <br />

<b>What services does Threadless provide?</b> Threadless provides both an online community and e-commerce platform.<p>The online community allows artists to submit t-shirt designs and for other artists and fans to rate those designs (and indicate whether they would purchase them).<p>The e-commerce platform then takes the highest rated t-shirts every week, pays the artists for the designs, and then sells t-shirts with those designs.<p> <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It is like a traditional online t-shirt retailer but crowsources the designs and maintains a highly active and invovled community. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Digital artists and graphic designers, people interested in being part of a community, and people who want to buy creative t-shirts.<p>I once submitted a design a couple years ago but it fared poorly. I also voted for a t-shirt that succeeded and ended up buying it (I'll try and wear it to class one of these days). <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Artists submit designs; 200,000 have done so to date,<p>Community members rate the designs and help the Threadless staff decide which ones to print; there are about 2.4 million of them. <br />

<b>How does Threadless incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Artists make money when their designs are printed.<p>Community members are rewarded by the feeling that they are empowered to choose which designs get printed. Threadless also hires community managers to organize real-life meet-ups and keep members engaged. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Threadless ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company's internal staff reviews the highest rated designs to make sure they are appropriate and of sufficient quality. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> There votes are averaged to provide an aggregated score for each design. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Threadless advertises through banner ads all over the internet and SEM (I've seen a lot of advertisements personally in the last few years).<p>Contributors are either artists who then submit designs to the site. Communtiy members browse the designs and then rate and comment on them, indicating whether the shirt is something they would buy. Every week, the Threadless staff choose the 10 best designs and release them for sale, at which point anyone on the internet can purchase the t-shirts.<p> <br />

<b>What is the scale of Threadless in terms of users?</b> 2.4 million users <br />

<b>What is the scale of Threadless in terms of dollars?</b> $30 million <br />

<b>If Threadless were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> At 24 or 240 million users, the community would be significantly tougher to manage. Fake voting is already a problem but would become a much tougher problem to deal with after that scale. To ensure quality, raters could perhaps have karma points (based off of Reddit) or something similar that would assign a higher weight to their ratings given good behavior in the past.<p>Given that level of poularity, the company would have to also give its artists more money for each design to better motivate them, <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Threadless generate revenue?</b> The company sells the community-chosen t-shirts. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Matt Mickiewicz, Mark Harbottle <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Matt Mickiewicz started SitePoint Solutions, a content and community website for designers and developers, at age 14. After the site's users started having informal design contests, Mickiewicz decided to create 99designs to separate a marketplace for crowdsourced graphic design. <br />

<b>What services does 99designs provide?</b> Crowdsourced graphic design, primarily cheap logo and branding designs for small businesses, start-ups, and non-profits. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It replaces the informal design contests hosted on Mickiewicz's first company. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Many small businesses, startups, and non-profit organizations use this service. An organization answers questions in an online brief, chooses a type of design package, and launches a contest. Designers then submit their designs, to which the company can give feedback. After a week, the company picks the winner, signs the copyright agreement, and the winning designer is paid. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The contributors are graphic designers who submit work to design competitions. <br />

<b>How does 99designs incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Winning the design competition means that the designer has won the competition holder's business (and is thus compensated for their work). 99designs plays on graphic designers' need for portfolio work, along with the prize of a significant amount of money, in order to motivate participants. Many of the graphic designers are entry-level designers. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does 99designs ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company receives a large number of potential designers from its huge graphic designer contributor base. From the submitted designs, the company hosting the contest has the ability to provide feedback to ensure they're getting the design more geared towards their vision. <br />


	<b>If 99designs uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> The more competitions a designer wins, the more opportunities they'll be selected for. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Designers find contests, to which they submit their design to. The contest host can sift through these designs. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> 99designs markets easy design you'll love, allowing users to pick a type of design plan, the quality of the plan (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), with the assurance that the company will get a great design after a week. The plan quality relates to the number of designs a user receives and is allowed to provide feedback on. Graphic designers search for jobs best suited to their talents and post designs to the contest. Users get their chosen design at the end of the week, for the rate they initially agreed on. <br />

<b>What is the scale of 99designs in terms of users?</b> 331,153 contests (not necessarily same as number of users) <br />

<b>What is the scale of 99designs in terms of dollars?</b> $149 - $2,500 <br />

<b>If 99designs were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think its business model would still work well, assuming that the ratio of users to contributors remains the same / is higher. It could be possible the company would need to up its pricing packages, though I'm not sure. There are a huge number of businesses, start-ups, and non-profit organizations, and a great number of graphic designers trying to break into the business -- both who would be comfortable with using 99designs' services for the current pricing plans. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does 99designs generate revenue?</b> Users are charged a fee for posting a contest on their site. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Sam Street, Sean Plaice, and Bastian Lehmann <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2011 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not one that we can seem to find. <br />

<b>What services does Postmates provide?</b> The company provides an on-demand delivery service with a guaranteed delivery time under one hour, in which the user's postmate can pick up a list of items from any restaurant or store for a delivery fee under $10 (depending on location). It's essentially like having a personal assistant for an hour who can go to any store and pick up items for you. As the Postmates website states&#58; If it's an item in a store or restaurant in your city, we can deliver it. Get pizza from Little Star, donuts from Bob's Donuts, a new coat from Nordstrom, a picture frame from Crate &amp; Barrel, you name it. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> In a sense, Postmates updates Uber's delivery and pick-up service--Uber allows users to deliver an item to another location, or pick-up an item, but the Uber driver is not authorized to make a purchase on behalf of the user. Postmates are authorized to pay for your order, and you are charged upon delivery.<p>Additionally, Postmates is similar to Instacart. Instacart allows users to order groceries, and delivers them within one day (depending on the time of day in which the order was placed). On the other hand, Postmates has a shorter delivery time and has a larger selection of items.<p>Seamless and GrubHub allow users to order food from select restaurants, but Postmates allows users to order food from anywhere.<p>Moreover, whereas it may take a few days to order a clothing item online, users can order Postmates to go to an outlet that might sell that item and pick it up at the store so that the user can have it within an hour. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Many people order food online through services such as Seamless or GrubHub, but it's frustrating when the restaurant from which you want to order is not on either website, or doesn't offer delivery at all. With Postmates, a user can order from any restaurant, and the Postmate will pick up the order and deliver it. Thus, Postmates attracts those who order in food, as well as people who may be busy and could use someone to run an errand or two for them, such as picking up their dry cleaning, or getting a last minute birthday present for a friend.<p>I've used this service many times before, either to pick up groceries or to order food from restaurants that don't deliver (Chipotle or Sweet Green for example), and it's been a pleasant experience every time. The app allows the user to track exactly where the Postmate is, which is great, since we've all had the experience of ordering food, and then calling the restaurant extremely frustrated at the fact that the food hasn't come in over an hour and the delivery guy has already left the restaurant. With Postmates, you know exactly where your delivery is, and if it is delivered in over an hour, Postmates will refund your purchase. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The couriers, or Postmates as they're referred to, come from all over. Some are parents or college students trying to make some extra money on the side, while others are people with delivery backgrounds such as GrubHub or Seamless delivery guys or FedEx drivers, Uber drivers, Lyft drivers, etc. According to the company website, To be a Postmate you must take pride in delivering exceptional customer service. There are a few other basic requirements - you must be over 18; own a bike, car, truck, scooter or motorcycle; and have an upbeat and positive attitude. Postmates must also complete a background check, attend a 30-minute orientation, and attend an onboarding session before being accepted. <br />

<b>How does Postmates incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The Postmates website states that experienced Postmates make up to $20/hour on weekdays and $25/hour on weekends, and contributors are allowed to choose their own hours, making for an attractive job to make a little extra cash. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Postmates ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company runs a thorough background check on each of its Postmates, as well as making each Postmate attend an orientation, run a few test jobs, and have an in-person interview. Moreover, the customer service for the app is fantastic, and if the Postmate takes over an hour to make the delivery, Postmates will refund the purchase. <br />


	<b>If Postmates uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> After each delivery, you can rate the Postmate as well as write a review about that Postmate. When placing an order, you see your Postmate's name, photo, and rating. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Only in the case of alcohol and cigarette deliveries. In these cases, the standards vary by state. For example, at the moment Postmates can deliver alcohol and cigarettes in New York, as long as the Postmate checks ID upon delivery, whereas in Philadelphia (where Postmates just recently launched within the past two months) Postmates cannot yet deliver alcohol or cigarettes. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> N/A <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> At the moment, the majority of Postmates' expansion has been due to word-of-mouth rather than formal advertising campaigns. The contributors contribute by being available during their own set hours to make deliveries for the users, either by bike, car, or truck. This app allows users to pay a small fee to have practically any item that they could buy in a store delivered quickly to their home, making their lives easier and saving time. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Postmates in terms of users?</b> As of April, 2014, Postmates were making an average of 10,000 deliveries per week. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Postmates in terms of dollars?</b> Postmates hasn't disclosed their revenue. <br />

<b>If Postmates were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> If the company were to scale to 100 times its current size, it would need to depend on a much larger workforce of postmates. For this reason, the customer review aggregation would become more important (all couriers we have encountered so far have had a 5 star rating). Additionally, Postmates currently has a culture in which the CEO himself meets with the Postmates, and social events are thrown each week. It may prove to be difficult to maintain this culture when the company scales, and so it may be beneficial for an academia system be set up in the various cities that is responsible for instilling the company's culture and requirement for good attitude. By maintaining this culture, and ensuring that all Postmates interact, the company may be able to scale while still ensuring a high service quality.<p>Furthermore, the company currently generates revenue by taking a percentage of the delivery fee, as well as payments made by restaurants to be featured on the home screen. If the company scales, then restaurants would be willing to pay a much larger fee to be featured on the home screen. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Postmates generate revenue?</b> The company hasn't disclosed its total revenue, but it generates revenue by taking a certain percentage of each delivery fee. It also has a smaller revenue stream coming from the preferred restaurants/stores that it features on the apps home screen. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Ory Okolloh, Erik Hersman, David Kobia, Juliana Rotich <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Yes, it was founded during the aftermath of the 2007-2008 Kenyan election crisis. Meaning testimony in Swahili, Ushahidi was originally built so that the people of Kenya could report the political violence occurring through the country. It later expanded to serve a wide range of communities and problems through similar techniques. <br />

<b>What services does Ushahidi provide?</b> The company aggregates information concerning political crises and natural disasters to inform the public and make reporting more accurate for the betterment of society. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> This is very difficult, as Ushahidi provides a variety of services and provides information to the public, rather than provide a service per se. A typical example of how somebody might use it would be when a crisis occurs. Especially during the beginning of the crisis, it is difficult for the government, local authorities, or other organizations to gather information and direct the public. Ushahidi allows the people to report information from the scene more easily, so that a person can simply look at the maps and better make decisions about how to react / where to go during the emergency.<p>Ushahidi's improved maps in Haiti were mentioned in class as an example. Additionally, they have done similar things after snow emergencies in Europe, flooding in the Missouri River Basin, and during the political unrest in Libya. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The people are the common citizens in an area in crisis. Quite typically, they are being affected by the crisis, and would like assistance. They likely represent a large part of the population, as anybody can report to Ushahidi as long as they own a cell phone (one can report events via text message, internet is not needed). <br />

<b>How does Ushahidi incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The contributors are often directly affected by the crisis, and would like to let others know what is happening. They are motivated by 1) the assistance they may receive by reporting their troubles and/or 2) the knowledge that they are helping their community/country. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Ushahidi ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Ideally, the contributors are hoping to receive help, and would want to the advice they report to be accurate, and there is no direct incentive to give false information, especially in non-political crises.<p>Still, those who administrate the maps or other services do have the power to moderate content. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> Roughly equal numbers <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Ushahidi aggregates contributions automatically without filtering by default, although those who organize a crowd-sourced map can moderate data. The ultimate goal of this crowd sourcing is to gather the information for human use, so their aggregation simply consists of collecting. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Presumably, the service spreads through word of mouth within the community and is encouraged by charitable/humane organizations. Users contribute via interactive maps (or via sms, email in the case of products other than Crowdmap). Their contribution can sometimes result in assistance being delivered to these people, and the available knowledge can often improve organized responses to the problem and shed light on the issue at hand. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Ushahidi in terms of users?</b> The information gathered by Ushahidi can improve the lives of millions. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Ushahidi in terms of dollars?</b> This is difficult to say as it is hard to give a price to information goods. <br />

<b>If Ushahidi were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> If this scaling indicates the number of employee, the company could not grow by such a factor given it's relatively limited revenue. Already, much of the work and a sizable portion of the revenue come from voluntary contributors.<p>If this means the size of contributions, then it could scale quite easily, as the data is easily aggregated with little filtering. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does Ushahidi generate revenue?</b> In addition to donations, the organization generates revenue by deploying its quality software for clients. Ushahidi emphasizes that it does not accept money from governments to maintain neutrality in political crises. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> This organization was a little difficult to profile as a non-profit. As such, revenue is not the main concern and we cannot analyze this company in the same way, especially when it comes to market analysis, incentives to users, competitors, etc. It was a very interesting company to profile because of this fact. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> 2011 Iceland Constitutional Council (25 members) <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2011 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> In 2008, a banking crisis resulted in the near-collapse of the Icelandic economy. The banks were heavily in debt due to the global recession and corruption among the political and banking elite. In addition, citizens were unhappy that many of the country's rich fishing and geothermal national resources were being increasingly owned by foreign interests. In 2009, the center-right government collapsed and was replaced by a government that appointed a council of 25 ordinary citizens to recommend constitutional reform to the Althing, the parliamentary body of Iceland. <p>	94% of the population of Iceland (estimated at 324,000) have access to internet, making it one of the most “online” countries in the world. The constitutional council decided to solicit suggestions for constitutional reform on Facebook and Twitter via a six-question survey. After using the answers to this survey to develop an initial draft, the council gradually iterated over twelve drafts of the new legislation and consistently communicated with ordinary citizens via Facebook and Twitter. Updates of each draft were posted on a public website. Naturally, the opportunity to influence legislation made the survey incredibly popular. By the end of the voting period, over half of Iceland's voting-eligible body had contributed in some way to the process. <p> <br />

<b>What services does Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution provide?</b> The Constitutional Council was an assembly of 25 people responsible for writing Iceland's new Constitution. At the beginning of their process of writing, they held a national vote on six yes/no questions for the citizens to vote on. During their process of writing, they made all of their drafts available to the public and posted videos of their meetings. They actively encouraged comments and feedback and incorporated that into their future drafts.<p>In short, they provided the service of giving citizens a voice in the writing of their Constitution. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It replaces the traditional way that Constitutions were written&#58; by a small group of intellectuals in an intentionally secretive and obscured manner. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> The Constitutional Council posts a draft of the Constitution on Facebook and the public website, and a user can comment on it with feedback and suggestions. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone with an internet connection could comment on the constitution Facebook or Twitter. Because the constitution is written in Icelandic, it is a foregone conclusion that only Icelandic nationals or expats would contribute. <br />

<b>How does Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Obviously, the ability for an ordinary citizen to potentially influence legislation, especially after an economic crisis, was a powerful incentive to participate. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The Constitution wasn't /truly/ crowdsourced in the sense that the text that went into the Constitution did not for the most part come from “the crowd.” Instead, commenters' feedback was incorporated into the Constitutional Council's decisions as to what to include, exclude or change in their draft of the Constitution. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Obviously, the ability to influence legislature is normally heavily “regulated”. A parliament member's ideas for change are regulated by his/her voting rights and the voting of all other members of the parliamentary body. In this case, the Althing, Iceland's parliamentary body, was dissolved before it could pass or reject the final draft because of political reasons. Elections were coming up and the ruling party was wary about experimenting with government legislature on a national scale. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> For the initial poll of six yes/no questions, the results were simply aggregated by summing up the number of votes on each one. For the comments on the successive drafts of the constitution, members of the Constitutional Council would comb through all of the online comments and take them into consideration, and they would even regularly meet with the commenters. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service was advertised via traditional social media channels (Facebook/Twitter), local and international publications, and the public website that continuously issued new drafts and newsletter updates. Initially, citizens answered a six-question yes/no survey that served as the base of constitutional reform (one of the questions was&#58; “do you believe Iceland needs constitutional reform?”). Afterwards, the members of the council asked for direct written feedback on Facebook/Twitter, which they interacted with and incorporated into the drafts. In the end, citizens got an assurance that their suggestions were being taken into consideration. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution in terms of users?</b> 120,000 people <br />

<b>What is the scale of Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution in terms of dollars?</b> Iceland 2012 GDP&#58; $13.66 Billion <br />

<b>If Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> In general, I would guess that likelihood of success of a crowdsourced Constitution is inversely correlated with size of the country. For one, with more people, each person feels that his/her voice accounts for a smaller portion of the overall voice going into the Constitution. This leads to increased bystander effect and a lower participation rate (which was low in Iceland's case to begin with). This would lower the legitimacy of the Constitution's claim to truly represent all citizens' interests. Additionally, even though a lower percentage of people would participate, there would still be a higher volume of comments and feedback for the Constitution writers to comb through. This could lead to commenters trying to make more sensationalist comments for the sake of gaining Likes, Retweets, and Upvotes, just so they can get noticed, rather than truly substantive suggestions that writers can pick out for their own merits. Plus, most other countries do not have as high of prevalence of the Internet as Iceland does, so many citizens would be forcibly excluded due to their technical incapability. It is also unclear how this situation would play out in the United States, which has a much more diverse electorate and has a very polarized political system at present. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Government body <br />

<b>How does Iceland's Crowdsourced Constitution generate revenue?</b> Because we're discussing the use of crowdsourcing in a governmental context, this question seems non-applicable. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> This experiment unfortunately didn't get passed by the government, but its high engagement and large comment base suggest that this crowd-governance model may be something that we see popping up in isolated situations in bigger countries and perhaps affecting larger legislation in smaller countries with high Internet access like Iceland. Japan and/or South Korea would be good frontiers to try this next. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not really, the founders just saw an opportunity <br />

<b>What services does StackOverflow provide?</b> The service allows users to post questions and view user-suggested and voted upon answers to the questions, in addition to allowing the users to search a database of prior Q&amp;A's to help find a solution. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It basically is a search engine specialized to help with programming and writing code by searching a database of Q&amp;A's for relevant answers or allowing users to post questions to be answered by the community. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> If I have a question about code I am writing, or I come across a tough bug, I search StackOverflow <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone can answer someone's question on stackoverflow, and can critique or upvote another user's answer to the question. <br />

<b>How does StackOverflow incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The company awards points and badges (social rewards) to users who provide good answers and has a leaderboard of the best responders <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does StackOverflow ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company will remove bad posts or mark them as non-questions, bad questions, etc and will do the same for answers.  Additionally, the community will down-vote bad answers and up-vote good answers, so the user will know which answers to use for guidance. <br />


	<b>If StackOverflow uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Users register for an account, and can answer questions posed by Requesters.  These questions are assigned a certain amount of Reputation by the Requester.  The users then answer the question, and vote on others' answers.  The Requester can then choose the answer that fixed his problem, and the reputation is assigned to whoever created that answer.  Therefore, users with the consistently best answers will have the highest reputation. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Each question has its own webpage, that ranks all of the answers according to their votes and (if applicable) the answer chosen by the Requester <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b>  <br />

<b>What is the scale of StackOverflow in terms of users?</b> Over 1.3 million registered users, many unregistered users visit the site a day <br />

<b>What is the scale of StackOverflow in terms of dollars?</b> No fee to use, but would be at least millions in tech fees and lost productivity.  It's also privately held, so there are no financials on the ads or job listings.  It's enough to fund a website with a huge dataset and hundreds of thousands of daily page views. <br />

<b>If StackOverflow were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The business model would only be better.  More users mean better and faster answers, with more users to filter out the bad answers and upvote the good answers. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does StackOverflow generate revenue?</b> The company generates revenue through ads as well as job listings on their site <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> A great website, and is part of a larger shell called Stack Exchange <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Senh Duong, Patrick Lee, Stephen Wang <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> August 12, 1998 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Senh Duong, creative director at Design Reactor, developed the website as a side project, starting with aggregating reviews of all Jackie Chan movies. From its launch, the site was immediately successful, going viral linked with hit movies such as Star Wars&#58; Episode 1 and The Blair Witch Project. Patrick Lee and Stephen Wang tried to convince Duong to come back to Design Reactor, bringing Rotten Tomatoes with him, but eventually decided to instead join him at Rotten Tomatoes as its own entity, with their company, Design Reactor, as a sister company. <br />

<b>What services does Rotten Tomatoes provide?</b> Aggregate movie and TV show reviews by users and critics; provides an aggregate rating. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Professional Movie and TV Show reviews (in newspapers and other publications). <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> The user can either expressly go to the Rotten Tomatoes website to look up reviews and ratings or (more commonly), use Flixster to look up showtimes, etc., where the user will also be shown the movies rotten tomatoes score and reviews (from critics and users). As a user, I've only used it in the context of Flixster, but the ratings definitely carry serious weight, and if I see a movie with a low rating (below 60% will show a green rotten tomato), I will often check the reviews, and often not see the movie. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Users with Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster accounts (users can log into Rotten Tomatoes with with Facebook accounts as well). Users can also register as Critics, although they must be cleared as critics at well-standing publications, or something similar. Users' contributions are marked and sorted as either by regular users or by critics. <br />

<b>How does Rotten Tomatoes incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> People are likely to contribute to have their opinions heard, especially if they felt very strongly (in one direction or the other) about a film or TV show. If a user's reviews get many likes, they can become critics and their reviews will carry more weight. There are also message boards on which users can discuss movies, TV shows, etc., so there is a social interaction incentive to communicate and contribute as well. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Rotten Tomatoes ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Rotten Tomatoes staff read critics' reviews and decide whether they are positive or negative. When a film or TV show has received enough reviews, the staff will also write a brief summary on the consensus for the movie that takes in all the reviews. A movie is certified fresh if it has more than 75% positive reviews and at least 40 reviews from Tomatometer critics (5 of which must be top critics). This ensures that they are providing an accurate and well-rounded review of the movie/show. <br />


	<b>If Rotten Tomatoes uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> As above, top critics are cleared by the staff, and their reviews must also have a certain number of likes from other users. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> As above, the Rotten Tomatoes staff rates each review as positive or negative, and the final score is the percentage of positive reviews. On Flixster, the reviews are also sorted between users and critics. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> A user goes onto the website or Flixster app, picks the movie she wants to review, and writes her review. The Rotten Tomatoes staff will determine if the review is positive or negative, which will affect the movies score. The review will also be listed when other users look at the movie's rating, either under critics or users, depending on who wrote the review. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Rotten Tomatoes in terms of users?</b> 3,950,000 visitors / day; Alexa Rank&#58; 686 <br />

<b>What is the scale of Rotten Tomatoes in terms of dollars?</b> $ 21,329,640 / year <br />

<b>If Rotten Tomatoes were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> No, because revenue is generated from advertising. Advertising hits viewers as well as contributors, but scaling up contributors does not necessarily increase total views (users + contributors), and further, while ad revenue is more closely linked to total views, it is not linearly correlated. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Part of Flixster, which is owned by Warner Brothers, which is a subsidiary of Time Warner <br />

<b>How does Rotten Tomatoes generate revenue?</b> The company's primary source of revenue, like many web companies, is online advertising <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> David Baker and Seth Cooper <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> The founders were working with another automated solution to predict the natural structures of various proteins. This solution used protein structure prediction algorithms, which take lots of time and processing power to run. This program was later expanded to utilize the processing power of people's PCs around the world to run some of the algorithms. Users began to notice that they could see potential solutions to the structures, but since they couldn't interact with the algorithms they couldn't add their own insights into the program. Thus, FoldIt was born. The founders and their team turned the program into an interactive game that merges distributed computing and algorithmic predictions with the ability for people to tinker with the protein structures themselves. <br />

<b>What services does Foldit provide?</b> It provides people with the opportunity to play an entertaining game while helping scientists solve challenging problems in biochemistry, such as how to target and eradicate diseases in the body. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It replaces a purely algorithmic approach that was used to predict the native structures of various proteins, called Rosetta. This was then extended to utilize the processing power of user's personal computers, by developing a distributed computing program - Rosetta@home. However, users became frustrated that they could not interact with the program itself, eventually leading to an interactive version known as Foldit. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> An individual can sign up to donate a portion of his or her own computing power to assist with the project. In addition, they may participate actively in the game, which lets them play with the different configurations of proteins until they or the program think that they have found a potential solution. This solution is then analyzed by the program to predict how viable the structure is. If it is deemed a realistic possibility, the solution is sent to the experts at the University of Washington for further analysis. Since there are so many possible configurations for each protein, the possibilities are seemingly endless. The contributions from users help accelerate the prediction process. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone, probably mostly online gamers <br />

<b>How does Foldit incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> They have created a game like interface for the program, which in turn provides users with intrinsic motivation to configure better guesses. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Foldit ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The best guesses from users are first analyzed by the algorithms that the FoldIt team has been working on since the program's inception. The ones that stand out in that pool are presented to the experts themselves, who continuously monitor the quality of the results that the algorithms churn out. <br />


	<b>If Foldit uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Players are rated based on frequency of success in guessing viable protein shapes.  Highest scoring configurations are then sent to experts for further analysis. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> Roughly equal numbers <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> All solutions are collected by a central system and rated by viability - the highest scoring entries are then sent to experts for further analysis. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is advertised as is; the website encourages contributors to solve puzzles for science, and explains to them what the goal of the project is and why it matters. The users then play the game, and they get intrinsic gratification when the do well. When they do well, the project's scientists accrue data that will help them solve the puzzles involved in predicting the natural shapes of proteins. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Foldit in terms of users?</b> 240,000 users as of 2012 <br />

<b>What is the scale of Foldit in terms of dollars?</b> N/A <br />

<b>If Foldit were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> It would still work relatively well because a lot of the analysis of how well players do is done algorithmically. However, if there were that many more people playing and contributing viable solutions, the scientists would probably have to expand their human team to keep up. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Research Project <br />

<b>How does Foldit generate revenue?</b> It does not generate revenue, as it is a university sponsored research project. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> The project is regularly featured in documentaries about how crowd-souring and human computation are changing the future of science. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> April 2012 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Coursera was started by two Stanford University computer science professors who wanted to make quality higher education more accessible to the public. Andrew Ng taught a free machine learning course online and found over a 104,000 users from all over the world enrolled for the course. After only a month into teaching the machine learning course, Ng and colleague Daphne Koller left their tenured faculty jobs to start Coursera full time in April 2012 after raising $16 million from a round of venture funding. <br />

<b>What services does Coursera provide?</b> Coursera provides massive open online courses (MOOCs), typically at the university level. These courses are designed and taught by professors at universities that Coursera has partnered with. The format of these courses are short videos, quizzes, and problem sets. In some courses, the pace is set by the user while other courses are regulated by the professor. There is also Q&amp;A section for each course. Verification certificates are offered for some courses for pay. There are also specializations offered; these are essentially a series of courses on a related topic. Specialization certificates are awarded if verification certificates are earned in each of the courses. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Coursera is an improvement in the online education space and is unique in multiple regards compared to previous competitors. It was one of the first (although multiple similar companies, including edX and the Minerva Project, started at the same time) to offer quizzes and problem sets alongside educational videos. Khan Academy, which started in 2006, offers mostly educational videos, without the extra testing. Udacity, which began in January 2012, offers mainly courses in computer science. Coursera has a range of selections, including STEM as well as humanities courses. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Users of Coursera consist primarily of people who want to learn for their own interests and/or learn new skills that could make them more attractive to employers. Furthermore, Coursera's users wish to learn for free, or learn at only a small cost. Users sign up for an account and then sign up for courses based on their interest areas. Users can then proceed through the videos, quizzes, problem sets, and peer-reviewed assessments of problem sets either at their own pace or, for some courses, at the pace set by the instructor. Courses that are self-paced can be started at any time, but courses that are not can only be joined when sessions are scheduled. All the courses can be taken for free, and once the course is completed, a certification of completion is awarded. Some courses offer “verified certificates” upon completion, but this requires payment from the user. The “verified certificates” are certifications by Coursera and the university providing the course that the user has successfully completed the course; it requires verification of user identity to ensure the user and not someone else is doing the work. Successfully obtaining verified certificates in all of the courses in a specialization series allows the user to get a “specialization certificate.” Specialization series are a group of courses that allow the user to gain skills in a specific area, such as data science or modern music. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The people who contribute services are primarily professors at universities. Coursera has partnered with 100 global universities and 7 non-university partners so far. <br />

<b>How does Coursera incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The contributors of Coursera (aka the professors) are primarily motivated to participate by their own interest to contribute to the education platform. Many of the universities have their own education initiatives, like Penn's Open Learning program. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Coursera ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company partners with universities to provide courses so there is some inherent guarantee of quality of the content because of the high level at which the professors who teach the courses are employed. The full process is as follows. University staff work together to ensure the quality of the course description page before it is submitted to Coursera. Coursera then verifies the course description page and uploads it to their website. The instructor must provide a detailed description of the content and resources to be used at least two months in advance through a Course Development Agreement (CDA). The instructor, university staff, and Coursera all sign the CDA, holding them responsible for the class. A minimum amount of content needs to be uploaded a month before the class. Instructor and university staff are responsible for continued content monitoring during the course, and Coursera continues monitoring student discussions and technical issues. If Coursera notices any course issues on the student discussions, it relays it to the instructor. Coursera also develops a system of feedback for the students to offer comments on the course to instructors. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Education at the university level is regulated by the government to some extent. Both public and private universities have to comply with certain government regulations, although private universities typically have much more freedom. The intent of government regulation is to provide a higher quality of education and to improve access to education. With regards to education quality, it's difficult to say whether Coursera meets the government's standards because its goal and approach differs from those at traditional universities. However, being that most courses are taught by professors at well-respected universities, Coursera's courses are of high quality. With regard to accessibility, Coursera does meet government standards. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Each course is individually prepared by staff at a university (or one of the non-university partners), and the courses are aggregated through the Coursera website. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is advertised as a free online educational platform that offers courses in a variety of subjects. The target audience is people who want to learn anything new; many are workers who want to freshen their skills as well as students who want to earn credit or learn something new for no credit. Contributors design courses and teach them through videos, as described in the question about how quality is regulated. The users are able to sign up for courses based on course descriptions for free or for a price if they want a verification certificate from Coursera and the university. After completion, a certificate or statement of completion is given for most courses. A more detailed explanation of verification certificates is in the question about how users use the service. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Coursera in terms of users?</b> Coursera had 7 million registered users as of April 2014, and it had 22,232,448 enrollments as of January 2014. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Coursera in terms of dollars?</b> Coursera had generated $1 million in revenue as of October 2013 (the most recent estimate we found). <br />

<b>If Coursera were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> We think that if Coursera were to scale up in size, it would still be able to successfully provide its services because it is primarily an internet-based service. However, we also believe that Coursera's current business model is not very profitable and that it will need to modify its business model if it wants to make more profit. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Coursera generate revenue?</b> Coursera generates revenue by&#58;<p>Charging for its Verified Certificates.<p>Receiving revenue from an Amazon.com affiliates program when users of the website purchase books suggested by professors. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> Despite having generated relatively little revenue so far, Coursera continues to generate a large amount of venture funding. Their most recent round in November 2013 raised $20 million and the total venture capital so far totals $85 million. Their current business model seems to focus more on the mission statement of providing high-level education to the general public, but it does not seem ideal for generating a lot of revenue. They did not have any substantial revenue before adding the option for paying for certificates in January 2013.<p>There has also been some talk about providing MOOC users with the a job-finding service and charging commission. Coursera hasn't added a corporate section yet but may do so in the future. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, Charles Adler <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 28 April 2009 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> The founder Perry Chen got the idea after he failed to play a show during the 2002 Jazz Festival because of the lack of funding. He found a great venue and reached out to their management, but in the end the show never happened—it was just too much money. He was bothered by the fact that the potential audience had no say in this decision. Then he started thinking - What if people could go to a site and pledge to buy tickets for a show? And if enough money was pledged they would be charged and the show would happen. If not, it wouldn't. That's where he started looking for partners to start Kickstarter <br />

<b>What services does Kickstarter provide?</b> It provides a platform for people to post their projects and get funding from the crowd. Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Project creators will reward the backers by sharing a piece of their projects to them. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> According to a news article in 2009 when Kickstarter was just started, Kickstarter expanded the crowdfunding model by Sellaband to not just bands but more general creative categories. There has been websites providing similar service at the time like FirstGiving, PledgeBank and Mob Incentive. Kickstarter updated the previous model to specifically promote creative projects, and does not take any ownership like some of the past models do - it only provides the platform for people to post and contribute, and started charging 5% of the money raised for its own profit and development. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> In order to make it creative project specific, Kickstarter has limited the categories of crowdfunding to Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film &amp; Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater. For example, if a independent film producer wants to make a theatrical piece but does not have enough funding, he can start a project on Kickstarter to raise money, and if successful, invite those who donate the most to his movie premiere or send copies to them.<p>A friend of mine who's building his start-up Vigo - a headset that will detect your drowsiness and keep you awake - put a photo of his prototype on kickstarter to raise money for larger manufacturing, and promise to reward donors who donate more than a specific amount by giving them a free copy of the headset once they are manufactured. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> In this case, people contributing services are the backers who contribute money to enable project creators to finish their project. It is not particularly a kind of service, but more funding related patronage. <br />

<b>How does Kickstarter incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Kickstarter uses a all-or-nothing model, meaning that if a project doesn't meet its funding goal, no money will be charged from the users. This gives users incentive to contribute and mediate bystander effect. If people want to see a project come to life, they're going to spread the word. Moreover, project leaders will reward contributors if the project is successfully funded, usually in a related way (e.g. if an art project is successfully funded, contributors will receive a copy of that art) <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Kickstarter ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Since the patronage service from the contributors only include donating money, in this case the quality of the users - people who post their projects - are more important for the quality of the company. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn't fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. However, Kickstarter does not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. On Kickstarter, backers (you!) ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Money pledged by donors is collected using Amazon Payments. No money will be charged before the project reaches its goal, and if it does, Kickstarter will charge the credit cards provided by backers, aggregate all the money, take 5% fee (Amazon will take 3-5% as well) and give the rest to the creator. The platform is open to backers from anywhere in the world and to creators from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> When the users want to raise money for their projects, they can post on Kickstarter with the amount of money they want, the cause of their project, detail budget plan, press articles, what they will make as final product, and how much reward people are getting based on their contribution. They can then share the link to social media, their friends and market about their idea to attract more contributor to donate to their product through Kickstarter. Eventually, if the goal is reached, they will get enough money for their product. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kickstarter in terms of users?</b> 175,240 Project created and 6,961,320 Total backers <br />

<b>What is the scale of Kickstarter in terms of dollars?</b> $1,305,226,696 total dollars pledged to Kickstarter projects <br />

<b>If Kickstarter were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think the model will still work, because Kickstarter does not develop anything themselves or take ownership of any of the projects - they merely provide a platform for creators to post their projects and contributors to donate, so the amount of work for the website itself is minimum - just to maintain the scalability of the site to support more posts, more accounts and more transactions. The incentive scheme wouldn't be affected too much either, because most creators on Kickstarter share the post with their family and friends and get the word out somewhere else through their own channel (interviews, social media, etc). It might only affect the competitiveness of getting featured on Kickstarter, because according to the research done by a Wharton professor, featuring does significantly increase the possibility of success.<p>The quality model might be affected more, Not for those contributors who come because they heard of their friends' projects or read about it on media or press - because they know the legibility of project creators before they go to those kickstarter pages - but for contributors who just go on Kickstarter and browse for new projects to donate, scaling up to 10 or 100 times means there might be more scams out there on the site (just like Criaglist), and it's much harder to verify with their own judgement since Kickstarter doesn't provide any reputation system or guarantee of completion. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Kickstarter generate revenue?</b> Kickstarter originally didn't charge any transaction fee according to an article from 2009, but now charge 5% of all the money raised for a project before giving the money to the project creators. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> One thing I was trying to figure out at the beginning of this research is whether the creators or the backers on kickstarter are users. Traditionally, on a crowdsourcing website, contributors are those who post and users are using the service, while on kickstarter, the real users are those creators, because they go to the website demanding funding for their projects. Backers became the contributors and contribute their money. Therefore, most content on the site are created by the users. Here the definitions of user and contributor are a bit blurry, because everyone comes to the platform both with some demand and things they can supply, which I think is the core of crowdsourcing platforms - to create a win-win situation for both users and contributors (however they are defined) <br />

	Yelp sources local reviewers and amateur critics to review local services, thus giving small businesses a way to advertise and be compared by other consumers.

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jeremy Stoppelman, Russel Simmons, Geoff Donaker <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> Oct. 2004 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Stoppelman and Simmons were working on a startup after leaving Paypal when Stoppelman caught the flu.  Not having a good method of finding local doctors to consult, he came up with the idea that there should be a service that let consumers rate the services they used locally, so that others would be able to find and use the same services. <br />

<b>What services does Yelp provide?</b> For consumers&#58; solves the pain points of locating and rating services.  Makes it easy to find what other customers thought of a specific business.<p>For small businesses&#58; can pay for advertising to be shown at the top of a search results list, can pay for Yelp to host a Yelp elite party at the business in order to garner more valuable reviews that attract more customers.  Improves visibility. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b>  <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> I primarily use Yelp to find local restaurants to visit.  Going to the page of the restaurant shows other users' reviews and the average rating for the restaurant, allowing me to easily scroll through and pick the one that other people think has the best food.  Without Yelp, I would have no way of judging the difference between local restaurants without visiting them myself. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The Yelp elite are people who have been identified as having a certain amount of clout in the community, or who use Yelp on a daily basis and have many followers.  These elite users are invited to parties by the company where they then contribute reviews to the business's page, expanding the amount of data and ratings that the business has.<p>Normal users also contribute ratings and reviews, but there are many users who don't necessarily review every place they've been to. <br />

<b>How does Yelp incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> For Yelp elite, the benefits are free parties (including food and drink) at the business they're invited to review, as well as a host of followers and the ability to be an amateur critic.<p>For normal contributors, there's always the chance that one will be picked to become Yelp elite.  The motivation for users to contribute reviews is mostly because they want to voice their honest opinions about a particular business if they had a great experience or a subpar one. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Yelp ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> There is very common criticism of Yelp and the quality of the reviews and users.  The quality checks are crowdsourced as well, with users being able to flag other users and the businesses that own their own pages able to respond or otherwise change the appearance of their reviews page.  However, Yelp has been accused more than once of driving revenue by essentially blacklisting some small businesses that do not pay them for advertising services, lowering them to the bottom of the search list or denying the removal of toxic reviews. <br />


	<b>If Yelp uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Users can rate other users' reviews to be useful, funny, or cool.  Users can also ask to be friends with other users, so that some prolific reviewers can gather large followings and thus gain reputation.  Yelp elite are designated by the service as such, and their reviews have more value than others due to their reputations. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Reviews are aggregated on the main page of a local business and anyone who visits the page can read them. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Yelp doesn't do any advertising to look for reviewers, it merely provides a platform where local businesses have pages and reviewers are composed of anyone who has used the service and wishes to post a review.  The reviewers type up good or bad reviews, their experiences, what they ate/saw/did, and a star rating of the business, and the users who then visit the webpage can read that review along with others before deciding whether to use the business's service. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Yelp in terms of users?</b> 112 million unique/month <br />

<b>What is the scale of Yelp in terms of dollars?</b> Revenue $233 million as of 2013, but Yelp has never been profitable. <br />

<b>If Yelp were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> For Yelp to be 10 or 100 times its size, it would have to be in complete control of the entire market that is local business advertising worldwide.  Its business model is based off of advertising and search ranking, so it will scale just as Google did.  The incentive scheme for local businesses will only increase with the number of users, and the reviews will keep pouring in just as an effect of human nature. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Publicly traded company <br />

<b>How does Yelp generate revenue?</b> The local businesses can pay to advertise their pages, which makes them rise to the top of the search rankings and get more visibility to customers.<p>A few years ago, Yelp came out with Yelp deals, which displays discounts on each business that Yelp users can claim, thus driving more traffic to the business and getting a cut of the extra revenue generated.<p>I was told by one of the engineering managers that they're looking to work on a food ordering system and to integrate it with the business pages, much like Seamless/Grubhub/etc. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Adam D'Angelo, Charlie Cheever <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> June 2009 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not particularly. The founders were both early employees of Facebook who sought to disrupt the Q&amp;A space, which many would agree was somewhat of a mess excluding certain niche communities such as Stack Overflow. <br />

<b>What services does Quora provide?</b> The company allows users to ask and answer questions. Users earn credits from the community by posting interesting questions or well-written and helpful answers. Those credits then allow users to ask experts questions. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Quora is an update to the online Q&amp;A business model. The monetization model is not new as it will likely be heavily ad-based. However, Quora updates the way in which high quality questions and answers are incentivized. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> You first sign up via email, Google, Facebook, or Twitter. You then select a variety of topics you are interesting in. The homepage is a list of questions that Quora believes you may be interested in. I have primarily used it as a tool to find information via pre-existing questions and answers on very specific topics where I desire insider information from experts. Quora has been very good at suggesting questions I may be interested in. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone, although Quora is notable because it also has well-known contributers such as Michael Dell. <br />

<b>How does Quora incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Quora allows access to better answers to your questions from experts if you spend credits. Credits are only acquired by first providing high quality answers yourself. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Quora ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Quora ensures quality content through the incentive scheme described previously. <br />


	<b>If Quora uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Users can up-vote questions and answers. Users can also pay credits to experts to receive a presumably high quality answer to a question. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Questions are grouped into topics. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service does not appear to advertise via ads. In my experience, much of it's advertising has been via digital word-of-mouth and email sharing. All users are both question- and answer-contributers. Users are incentivized to provide high quality answers in order to receive high quality answers of their own. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Quora in terms of users?</b> Estimated between 3 and 5 registered users. However, Quora notoriously does not share its growth numbers. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Quora in terms of dollars?</b> $0 revenue. $900 million valuation. <br />

<b>If Quora were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think the incentive scheme would scale very well, especially since it has already managed to establish a large community of high quality users with many credits. Since experts and users with an established track record are given higher priority, the system does not succumb to the problems of a pure democracy (e.g. Yahoo Answers). <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Quora generate revenue?</b> The company generates zero revenue and is still in the funding stages. However, the Founder D'Angelo has stated that the site will likely introduce ads in 2015. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jessica Greenwalt, Jared Heyman, Leonardo Setyanto <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> October, 2012 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Yes, according to TechCrunch, The company was founded by Jared Heyman, who had previously built the Internet survey company Infosurv. After his sister spent three years with a rare, undiagnosed illness, he realized that the same kind of predictive survey technology could be used to help those who are sick figure out what they are suffering from. <br />

<b>What services does CrowdMed provide?</b> The company crowdsources medical data, while at the same time provides value via its patented predictive technology, to help its users identify illnesses and aid medical professionals. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Users pay for a Med Detective premium, while the company takes a 10% cut. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> A user with an unknown med diagnosis posts there health history/symptoms online allowing all users to solve cases, if they want specialized med detectives they pay a premium. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Healthcare providers, students, and any person who wants to participate solving cases. <br />

<b>How does CrowdMed incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> According to FAQ&#58;<p>Point rewards and cash compensation offered by patients are awarded to those Medical Detectives who contributed and/or assigned points to the best diagnostic or solution suggestion as determined by the patient or their physician. Patients may also direct up to 50% of their reward points and cash to named Medical Detectives who they found to be most helpful. Note that CrowdMed collects 20% of cash compensation offers as commission. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does CrowdMed ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> When a Medical Detective joins they have 20,000 points to allocate in their suggestions in patient cases, and adjust their points with confidence in that answer. Less popular cases have higher point rewards to help attract more Medical Detectives. Win cases and you get higher quality points, to earn more money. On the case side a refundable deposit needs to be given so that the person is 'real'. <br />


	<b>If CrowdMed uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> The DetectiveRating algorithm factors&#58; winning diagnostic and solution suggestions, point earnings, and peer ratings. DetectiveRating increase by suggesting the best diagnoses and solutions for cases, assigning points to others' suggestions, asking smart questions, and providing well researched insights in case discussions. Earning positive peer and patient ratings, will increase DetectiveRating and reputation points. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is advertised as another venue to recieve professional medical advice from the wisdom of crowds that should be used as a complement to physician practice. Contributors sign up to solve live cases, offer suggestions, and aim to be a part of the solution. If marked as helpful and part of the solution, they are rewarded a share of of the reward, with higher shares going to higher repped members. Users in the end receive another perspective to their med problem that they can use to consult a physician with. <br />

<b>What is the scale of CrowdMed in terms of users?</b> Approximately &gt; 100 users <br />

<b>What is the scale of CrowdMed in terms of dollars?</b> 10-20% of rewards (of about $100-$200). <br />

<b>If CrowdMed were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The incentive scheme would scale but as more people get the answer correct the more the reward money could be split up. The incentive scheme for patients versus users would have to stay at a 1&#58;30 ratio to keep balance in profitable cases with helpful advice. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does CrowdMed generate revenue?</b> CrowdMed collects 20% of cash compensation when a patient offers reward or pays for Med Detectives (higher rated users to solve the case). <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Garrett Camp, Travis Kalanick <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> March 2009 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Uber began in 2009 in San Francisco as UberCab with the mobile applications being launched for both Android and iPhone in 2010. By late 2011 the company had raised almost $49.5 million dollars in venture capital funding from Angel Investors in the Silicon Valley area as well as institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs, Menlo Ventures etc. <br />

<b>What services does Uber provide?</b> The company provides Ridesharing services. It works like a call a cab taxi service but provides chauffeur driven luxury vehicles at a marginally higher cost. The app provides billing and guidance and payment is made electronically via a credit / debit card. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> If you're looking for a taxi or a ride, you open the UBER app and specify your pickup location. You also specify the kind of vehicle you would like. Once an appropriate vehicle has been found the driver is contacted and messaged your details and he goes to pick you up from your specified location. After the driver drops you off you end the trip and exit the vehicle. Your credit card is automatically charged the fare for the trip. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone who owns a vehicle as specified by Uber's requirements and falls in one of the categories of cars they offer to customers can sign up to be a driver for Uber. They must meet certain standards and specifications but once they're approved they use the Uber app on their device to provide service to customers. <br />

<b>How does Uber incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Uber drivers are paid for every ride they undertake. The payment depends on the duration and distance covered. By pooling in available drivers Uber gives them higher custom than they'd be able to source on their own in the luxury travel sector. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Uber ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Uber ensures that the drivers contributing to the Uber network pass stringent quality and standard checks before they're officially commissioned to become a part of the Uber network. <br />


	<b>If Uber uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> After each ride, the customer has an option to rate the ride overall out of 5 stars as well as rate the ride under specific categories such as driver courtesy, cleanliness of the vehicle, driver professionalism etc. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Technically, Uber doesn't fall under a Taxi service and is thus exempt to many regulatory restrictions placed on Taxis. That said it is a car hire service and does require the drivers to have licenses as well as the cars to be registered. These regulations are enforced in order to ensure passenger safety and curb traffic violations. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> As customers rate a particular driver, the driver gets a rating out of 5 stars which is just the average of all the customer ratings the driver has received. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Uber's advertising is mainly through word of mouth and online advertisement. A popular campaign gave users their first ride free of charge upto a $40 limit. The second campaign gave every user $20 of Uber credit in case someone they referred to Uber signed up and took a ride. They even gave the referred person a $20 Uber credit voucher. <p>The contributors are the Drivers who sign up to drive for Uber, pass the quality control and requirements checks and then begin servicing Uber customers. Uber sends the drivers a notification when a customer requests a vehicle which matches theirs and they then go provide the customer with transport services. <p>For the customer, it provides easy simple door to door service. Their credit cards are directly charged eliminating the whole paying after a ride business. Uber can be called anytime via the app and come pick you up for free. Additionally the cars are all luxury vehicles and the drivers are professionals. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Uber in terms of users?</b> 12,000,000 completed rides in 13 - 14 <br />

<b>What is the scale of Uber in terms of dollars?</b> $1,109,303,828 <br />

<b>If Uber were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Logically Uber's business model is highly scalable. As Uber works on a commission basis, scaling would dramatically increase revenue. That said, because it's still a niche service only requested by select customers, it can be that scaling a 100 times would disrupt the supply - demand equilibrium that Uber has managed to achieve in the market today. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Uber generate revenue?</b> For every ride, Uber charges commission for providing the ridesharing / matching services. Uber takes a 20% cut from the final fare paid by the passenger. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Gilberto Cavallina <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2012 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> The company was started because historically, municipalities in Italy have had a hard time dealing with problems such as fixing roads and picking up garbage. More than merely signalling the problems to the local government (of which they're often already aware), it gives the local representatives incentive to fix the problems and recorded accountability if they don't, as italian politicians often sweep issues like this under the rug <br />

<b>What services does Comuni-Chiamo provide?</b> It is essentially a waze for signalling problems in common areas within municipalities, such as roads, traffic lights, destruction in public parks, etc. The service aggregates all these citizen's signals and makes the list available to both the community and local government officials. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> I've never used it because it is still not available in my municipality in Italy. But this service is intended for any citizen with a smart phone! It works particularly well in Italy because there are a lot of evident problems that go unfixed for years... <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Normal citizens who are tired of having small and easily fixable problems in their municipality <br />

<b>How does Comuni-Chiamo incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> the fact that the problem will eventually be resolved. But even more than that, the fact that they can hold government officials accountable for not taking care of the problems. With this app people in the government can no longer claim they didn't know about the problem. Also, normally signalling problems to local gov't is a huge hassle because you have to go to a police station and file a lot of paperwork, which obviously not many are willing to do! <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Comuni-Chiamo ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> they ask for evidence of the problem one sees and they don't allow duplicate entires about the same problem <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> it doesn't break any regulations because it is simply signalling. They are just taking the hassle and paper work out of filing a formal problem report with the local gov't <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> they don't allow duplicate reports for the same problem, but people can comment on hot and more pertinent topics to ensure they will be looked at more promptly <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> it's not really advertised in the mainstream, but only in the municipalities it currently operates in (~30). People contribute by signalling the problem and providing evidence of it on the platform. The user in the end will *hopefully* get this problem resolved by the municipality. The more people comment or make a specific problem 'hot', the more likely gov't officials will divert their attention to fixing it. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Comuni-Chiamo in terms of users?</b> ~300,000-500,000 <br />

<b>What is the scale of Comuni-Chiamo in terms of dollars?</b> N/A <br />

<b>If Comuni-Chiamo were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> it would work perfectly well because the incentives are extremely tangible even on a larger scale. People will have problems with the state of their municipality on a micro-level. The only problem I see is that if this is done in a place like NYC, then there's simply going to be too many reports for the gov't to possibly fix, but then again, the more people agree with one specific problem, the more attention it will get from the gov't <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Comuni-Chiamo generate revenue?</b> Through geo-targeted advertising <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> Let's go Italy!! <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> November 2011 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Duolingo was originally started as an academic project at Carnegie Mellon between Luis von Ahn and his PhD student Severin Hacker. Luis von Ahn was born and raised in Guatemala and saw firsthand how expensive it was to learn English, so after selling his second company reCAPTCHA to Google in 2009 Von Ahn decided to shift his focus towards language education. Von Ahn and Hacker had weekly half-hour meetings between 2009 and 2011 discussing ways to improve language education, resulting in the creation of Duolingo. <br />

<b>What services does Duolingo provide?</b> Duolingo provides a free learning platform for individuals to learn a new language. At the end of lessons, the app allows users to practice by translating real articles. By combining many translations from high-level users, Duolingo can create an accurate translation of an article. As a result, Duolingo also acts as translation service for companies such as BuzzFeed and CNN. In addition, Duolingo has a language certification service. To add new languages incubators are created so that bilingual individuals can come together and help build curriculums. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Duolingo updates both the language learning business model and the text-translation business model. Duolingo is able to provide a free language learning service for people, as opposed to other fee-based learning platforms. It also makes the learning process into a game by creating short exercises and awarding badges and points. At the same time, it is able to generate revenue by using the more traditional approach of charging companies for article translations. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Duolingo's services can be accessed both through their website and their downloadable app. It is free and available to anyone who creates a profile. The sign up process takes about 30 seconds and only requires an email. After signing up, a user just clicks on a language he/she wants to learn and can begin doing exercises. The current courses available for english speakers are primarily romance languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, etc. For non-english speakers the languages available are very limited. As users get better with a language, they can click on immersion and translate real articles for practice. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> People who are learning a language on Duolingo also contribute text-translations for articles that are sold to companies such as BuzzFeed and CNN. The curriculums themselves are also crowdsourced by bilingual communities that are moderated by Duolingo. <br />

<b>How does Duolingo incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Users are motivated to contribute and translate articles because it will help them learn a new language. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Duolingo ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Duolingo assures the quality of the translations by aggregating many translations of top performing users. In addition, peers can upvote translations and proofread translations. To ensure curriculum quality, adding new languages is a thorough process. There are three phases for the language incubator&#58; private, beta, public. To contribute, users must apply and show they are fluent in both languages. There are also moderators that compile and edit work. The company continually does A/B testing on curriculums to improve the effectiveness of exercises. <br />


	<b>If Duolingo uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> As exercises are completed in the curriculum, users are given points and badges which quantifies how well they know the language. In addition, user translations are checked by peers and are assigned upvotes or downvotes based on the quality. As you translate more articles you move up translation tiers. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Duolingo takes the translations of many users and combines them to create an accurate translation. Translations are also checked by peers to ensure they are accurate. When creating curriculums the company uses many contributors to create the content and then uses moderators to compile and edit work. A patented algorithm is used to ensure quality of the curriculums. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> A language curriculum is created by a group of bilingual users (most major languages already have a curriculum). An individual signs up for Duolingo and chooses one of these languages. The individual completes game-like exercises and gains experience points. As the individual gains proficiency he/she will choose articles to translate to practice skills. These articles have been posted to the website by organizations who will pay Duolingo for the translation service. Many individuals translate the same article. These translations are aggregated and given to the organization. In the end, the individual learns a language, the company gets an article translated, and Duolingo makes a small profit. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Duolingo in terms of users?</b> 38 Million Users <br />

<b>What is the scale of Duolingo in terms of dollars?</b> Duolingo does not provide revenue numbers; however, profit is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands <br />

<b>If Duolingo were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The business model is relatively scalable for wide spoken languages such as Spanish and French. As more companies join, there should be enough users to fill demand. As more users join, the learning process would not be affected so incentives will remain unchanged and quality will remain unaffected. However, scalability will most probably be limited for languages that are not in high demand due to the fact that not enough bilingual individuals will exist to generate the curriculum and not enough users will be able to translate the articles. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Duolingo generate revenue?</b> Organizations can upload documents onto Duolingo to be translated for a fee. The company has contracts with BuzzFeed and CNN to translate articles for their international websites. In addition, Duolingo also has a language testing service similar to the TOEFL iBT that it charges $20 for. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Dread Pirate Roberts is the pseudonym of the founder and operator of Silk Road. Ross William Ulbricht is currently accused of being DPR. <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> February 2011 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Silk Road was founded by Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, as what he or she calls a practical libertarian system. It was founded and designed to run on libertarian principles of no centralized power (like the government) and free markets. <p>Designed so that the state couldn't touch it for a very long time, Silk Road was built by DPR, not just for monetary reasons, but primarily to make a difference in the world markets. He or she believes that in such a free market environment, the existence of drug cartels and violence is minimized to almost zero, and the competitive nature of Silk Road also enforces quality products from vendors. <br />

<b>What services does Silk Road provide?</b> The company is an online marketplace. It works like any other marketplace like Amazon or eBay, in that it allows users to act like vendors or customers. <p>Vendors essentially stock the shelves at Silk Road, and put up goods for sale (typically shipped to any part of the world, from any part of the world) and customers place orders, and review the service and quality of goods provided by the various vendors. <p>Silk Road differs from Amazon and eBay, though, for 2 major reasons&#58;<p>1. Silk Road is completely anonymous. It used a Tor system which encrypts the location and meta-data of anyone accessing and hosting the website, making it really difficult for authorities to track down users. It also conducts all transactions in BitCoin, an online currency, which is unregulated in the global markets.<p>2. Apart from your regular goods like books, apparel, and merchandise (which comprise only a small fraction of transactions on Silk Road), the main bulk of transactions are narcotics from marijuana to LSD and heroin. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> It's Amazon-if Amazon sold mind-altering chemicals - Adrien Chen, Editor, gawker.com.<p>Silk Road builds off typical e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay (it certainly doesn't replace them, though). As stated before it enhances privacy by running on the Tor system and allowing trades only by BitCoin, and is used primarily for buying and selling narcotic substances. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> There is actually a blogspot post on using Silk Road titled Silk Road for Dummies (Linked in the reference section).<p>A typical user would download the Tor Browser, so that their IP and other meta-data is private, and would find the newest link to the Silk Road website. <p>They could then browse through the various goods on offer and purchase them via BitCoin. They have an escrow system by which you first need to make a deposit to Silk Road. Silk Road then transfers the money internally to the sellers account. The seller can withdraw this money in BTC at any time and even hedge the trade to the USD price of BTC at the time of the sale. DPR would pay any difference accounting from the volatility of BTC. <p>Finally, you are shipped your goods by regular mail and can go back to Silk Road and rate the seller for the experience, quality, reliability, etc. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone who wants to sell a gram of marijuana or a book to people who want to sell large quantities of heroin contribute their listings to Silk Road. The primary vendors are people who have a large number of listings of various quantities, some even offering sample packs for free. <p>Contributors tend to use the same pseudonym to gain a reputation and good reviews. This helps them sell more and contributors who try to scam the system are blocked out by low reviews. This exemplifies the free market environment that DPR founded the website for. <br />

<b>How does Silk Road incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Anyone looking to sell illicit goods is incentivized to sell on Silk Road because of the following reasons&#58;<p>1. It is a free market and anyone can make their mark.<p>2. Formation of cartels is impossible and violence due to drug turf wars and drug deals are almost eliminated. <p>3. The privacy system was very well designed and the website ran without the authorities being able to bust it for almost 2 and a half years.<p>4. Silk Road provides a platform to sell goods from anywhere on the world to anywhere else (though most users were based in the US and the UK). <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>How does Silk Road ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> The company tries to provide a free marketplace by really empowering the consumers through reviews. Consumers rate vendors and vendors with low ratings naturally die out. Further, Silk Road has certain rules that it enforces in terms of what can and cannot be sold on their website. Silk Road does not allow its vendors to sell child pornography, weapons, stolen credit cards, and contracts for murder. The company considers these against their morals because they consider it to cause harm to other innocents. <br />


	<b>If Silk Road uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> The reputation system works just like the review system of Amazon does. Customers purchase goods from vendors and rate them out of 5 stars. <p>Most vendors who scam and provide low quality service are naturally left out of the environment. Most vendors, however, have high rating which signals a very competitive environment, with high customer satisfaction. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Government regulations prohibit or control sale of many of the goods and substances that are sold on Silk Road. The intent of these regulations is to prohibit unhealthy usage of and addiction to these drugs.<p>Silk Road was made to provide the world with an alternate and unregulated marketplace based off the concepts of libertarianism. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Various products by many contributors are listed and sorted in terms of department. Search features allow users to browse through all the listings, listings by department, or listings by a particular contributor. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is very low key and not highly advertised. It's more of a word of mouth system that gets people on the site, as well as some blogs with the correct and updated url of the site. <p>Contributors choose to list products. Users can choose to buy these products, and the users get their product shipped to them. They can then review the vendor and his or her services. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Silk Road in terms of users?</b> About 146,946 buyers and 3,877 seller accounts. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Silk Road in terms of dollars?</b> $1.2 Million worth of transactions every month. <br />

<b>If Silk Road were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> An online market or e-commerce platform on a 10 to 100 times scale exists and scaling could definitely be possible in terms of the aggregation model, reviews, quality, incentive scheme, and business model. <p>What would be difficult to predict is whether there would be a compromise in terms of privacy because it might be difficult for the Tor system to scale up so much. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Silk Road generate revenue?</b> Silk Road charges a premium of every transaction that occurs on its website. Trade volumes on the website at its peak were about 1.2 million USD a month and revenue was close to $92,000 per month. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Logan Green, John Zimmer <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2007 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Lyft was initially launched as a service for Zimride, a ridesharing company that focussed more on long trips between cities.  In 2013, Zimride's name was changed to Lyft <br />

<b>What services does Lyft provide?</b> Lyft facilitates peer-to-peer ridesharing by allowing passengers to request a ride from certified community drivers. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Lyft updates the Taxi/public transportation system by allowing anyone to supply transportation with appropriate certification.  This sort of crowd sourcing is much different from centralized taxi companies or public transportation services. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> I need a ride to my doctor's appointment from campus and don't have a car, so I go on the Lyft app and request a ride. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Those who drive the cars. <br />

<b>How does Lyft incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Community drivers make donations from the passengers they transport. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Lyft ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Any driver averaging less that 4.5 stars is dropped from the service. <br />


	<b>If Lyft uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Lyft uses a stars system for its drivers to maintain quality service. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> Any transportation service has regulations due to its nature.  Safety is a big concern, so drivers receive a background check, are required to be 21 and have a year of driving experience, as well as necessary vehicle inspections and about a one-hour training session.  Individual states' legislation has proven problematic for Lyft.  For example, in New York, their drivers are required to be certified Taxi drivers, which dramatically changes the normal business model. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Lyft aggregates the contributions of its drivers in that the drivers all transmit their locations and passengers are assigned to the nearest driver. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Lyft advertises directly to passengers. Drivers contribute by offering their car as a form of transportation for strangers. In the end, users get a service that is more comfortable and conveient than other forms of transportation. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Lyft in terms of users?</b> 10,000-100,000s <br />

<b>What is the scale of Lyft in terms of dollars?</b> $100m <br />

<b>If Lyft were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Lyft would remain very similar if it scaled up 100+ times because that would just mean it established itself in cities all over the US and world. They would have to deal with much more litigation but the basics of the business would remain essentially the same. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Lyft generate revenue?</b> Lyft takes a 20% cut of each transaction. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> They are sweet! <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Danae Ringelmann, Slava Rubin, and Eric Schell <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Ringelmann co-produced a play while working on Wall Street, but had trouble funding it even though it was popular.  She wanted to find alternative revenue streams for funding, and went to business school to develop a business that would democratize funding. <br />

<b>What services does Indiegogo provide?</b> It allows users to source funding for all sorts of projects (Personal, Charitable, Start-Ups, etc) from individual people who contribute amounts that are far smaller than amounts a venture capital source would invest in something.  It also allows users to contribute to other user's projects, either in return for some perk (a product or some other alternative to an equity stake), or in return for nothing. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Someone might design a prototype for a new type of wearable technology and need more funding to get through the initial production phase.  They might create a campaign on Indiegogo soliciting donations and in return for certain levels of donations, offer copies of the product when it is completed (like pre-orders). <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone at all can contribute money. <br />

<b>How does Indiegogo incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> They participate because they believe in the cause or project, think something is a cool idea, or want to pre-order the product (at a discount). <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Indiegogo ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> It does not guarantee fraud protection (it used to but removed the guarantee).  Instead, it does claim to have algorithms that monitor its services and processes to protect against fraud that include reviewing contributors and companies and then performing a final review before funds are disbursed. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> The intents are to regulate equity and debt investments in companies.  Through the JOBS act of 2012, regulation applies to crowdsourcing equity and debt funding as well.  However, the regulations do not apply to Indiegogo or its major competitor Kickstarter because they do not offer returns on investment in the form of equity or debt agreements.  They only allow contributions, which may be in return for concrete products or perks. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Funds are pooled collectively with progress visible to the public. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Users make an posting including a video/pitch and what perks they are offering.  Contributors can browse the various projects posted and decide what to donate to.  The users at the end receive funds (minus fees) as long as the campaign is successful in reaching its funding target, unless they chose flexible funding. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Indiegogo in terms of users?</b> 10's of thousands to hundreds of thousands of campaigns are run <br />

<b>What is the scale of Indiegogo in terms of dollars?</b> Hundreds of millions of dollars are raised by all users combined <br />

<b>If Indiegogo were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think that its model would work pretty well, there is nothing about its concept that would struggle to scale since it is entirely electronic. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Indiegogo generate revenue?</b> The company charges users who post projects for funding a percentage of the funds raised. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, Nathan Blecharczyk <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> August 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> In 2007, two of the founders were not able to pay their rent for their SF loft at the time. So they made their living room into a bed and breakfast, accommodating three guests on air mattresses and providing homemade breakfast. Hence the name Air b and b. To raise money, they designed boxes of cereal with a presidential candidate on them and sold them for $40/box, before landing seed money from Sequoia Capital and YVentures. <br />

<b>What services does Airbnb provide?</b> The company provides a place where people can rent lodging. People can rent out their entire house or a room in their house. Every property is associated with a host whose profile includes recommendations by other users, reviews by previous guests, as well as a response rating and private messaging system. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Airbnb acts as an alternative rental/hospitality service option. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> I used the service on my spring break trip to Puerto Rico last year. I was traveling with 5 other college students and we rented an apartment in San Juan for 4 days. We carefully picked the lodging based on our budget and the reviews of the hosts, which were really helpful in our selection process. We were able to meet the host the morning we got there and she was very nice and gave us a place to store our luggage until the apartment was freed up from the previous guests and cleaned up by the maid. Overall, it was a really great experience and it was really nice to have an entire apartment to ourselves and be able to cook and relax on a big couch, things that would have not been possible if we stayed in a hotel. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Pretty much any willing individual can list their space on Airbnb and be a host. Listing options range from the entire house to dorm to igloo to tent. <br />

<b>How does Airbnb incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Airbnb primarily provides the platform that connects hosts to travelers. The incentive for the host is to make money on what would otherwise be unutilized space. The company also expanded it's services, including insuring hosts in case of theft or destruction of property, thus providing safeguards for hosts, and professional photographers to better advertise spaces. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Airbnb ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Airbnb has three ways of trying to ensure quality for both the guests and the hosts. First, hosts and guests must verify their identities, including photo ID and Facebook or LinkedIn profile match. Secondly, Airbnb has a profile and review system in place. Thus, poor quality will eventually reflect in the reviews, ensuring quality for other users and incentivizing better quality. Lastly, hosts and guests are able to message each other to personally screen one another. <br />


	<b>If Airbnb uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Every user has an online Airbnb profile. Host profiles will include recommendations by other users, reviews from previous guests, and ratings. <br />



	<b>If its service is typically regulated by the government, what are the intents of the regulations and does the company meet those standards?</b> The government does have hospitality laws in place to protect guest' safety and avoid negligence. Hotels, for example, must protect the confidentiality of their guests' identifying information. Airbnb has been under criticism for it's intrusive verification process, of which it is unclear as to who has access to that information or how it is used by the company. Due to its failure to meet hotel occupancy taxes, Airbnb is also illegal in NYC and San Francisco under many circumstances. <br />


<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> It is aggregated on a single web platform. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Once a host has signed up, they may list there space on Airbnb's platform. Airbnb also provides a service that will send professional photographers to a host space to take better pictures and better showcase the space for potential guests. Guest can then select a location, contact the host and vice versa. In the end, the user get to use the space listed for a certain period of time. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Airbnb in terms of users?</b> More than 2.1 million registered users <br />

<b>What is the scale of Airbnb in terms of dollars?</b> $2,5 billion valuation; $794.8 Million in funding <br />

<b>If Airbnb were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The company would scale well. Airbnb has grown from 120,000 listings at the start of 2012 to over 300,000 listings now. Guest numbers are growing exponentially as well. The company understands that they have to grow continuously to support the community.. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Airbnb generate revenue?</b> Airbnb make money directly from its users and contributors. At the moment, Airbnb charges hosts a 3% host service fee and guests a fee ranging from 6-12%. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Danae Ringelmann, Slava Rubin, Eric Schell <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2008 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> One of the co-founders, Danae Ringelmann worked in New York at JPMorgan. She was part of a networking group that connected with the media and entertainment industries. There, she realized that it was extremely difficult for independent filmmakers or producers of theatrical events to raise the funds needed for their ventures, and wanted to create a platform that better met their needs. <br />

<b>What services does Indiegogo provide?</b> It provides a platform of a social marketplace where people with ideas or small companies share their ideas with the world and others who believe these ideas are worth funding, can make donations. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> For small companies, filmmakers, and other independent, small groups, Indiegogo replaces the need to network directly with the large funding and investment groups. Instead, it allows them to take their ideas straight to the masses who donate very many small amounts of money. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Anyone with an idea can use this site. This includes filmmakers, companies, inventors, photographers, etc. An example of a large and well known company that used Indiegogo to fund one of their technologies was Canonical. Canonical used Indiegogo to raise over $12 million for their Ubuntu Edge smart phone. <p>In order to do this, they provided a description of the product needing funding, both through a video and written explanation. They then set a funding goal and deadline. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone who has access to the internet, can read the descriptions of products needing funding, and has the money to donate can contribute money on Indiegogo. <br />

<b>How does Indiegogo incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Mostly, contributors are motivated by their passion for the idea/product and this leads them to donate money. However, sometimes, the company or person behind the campaign can offer perks for donating certain amounts of money, which is also an incentive to contribute. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Indiegogo ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> While donations and contributions are non-refundable, the company does say that Our detection algorithms analyze data, spot suspicious activity, and identify any users attempting to take advantage of the platform. In addition, our team of Trust &amp; Safety experts identifies, reviews, and removes users and campaigns that may try to abuse the system. Thus, if many people have the same problem with the same campaign, it can probably be resolved. <br />


	<b>If Indiegogo uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> Slightly, it shows how much money campaigns have raised so far, and which campaigns are trending currently. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More contributors than users <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Since the contributions are of a monetary nature, the donations are just combined under the campaign. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> First the people behind the idea come together and create a campaign. The better the campaign and the more people behind it, the better. Next, they engage their community and share the campaign with as many people as possible. As the campaign becomes more successful, it improves its location on the Explore campaigns part of the website. This is where contributors are looking at campaigns that they potentially want to donate to. Once the campaign period is closed for donations, the users get the money that was donated. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Indiegogo in terms of users?</b> It provides one services, which is a online funding platform. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Indiegogo in terms of dollars?</b> It depends on the campaign. There have been campaigns that have only raised a few hundred dollars and also campaigns that have raised over 12 million dollars. <br />

<b>If Indiegogo were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think their business model would work pretty well. It is already quite a huge social funding marketplace. Perhaps the only thing that would suffer or be compromised is that smaller campaigns would have more difficulty gaining traction. However, there are different tabs and ways with which to search for different types of campaigns, so perhaps further developing those technologies would help to solve that problem. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Indiegogo generate revenue?</b> Indiegogo charges between a 4-9% fee on the funds raised by groups that use their platform. If a group achieves their goal, they are charged a 4% fee and if not, a 9% fee. This helps keep expectations within reason. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> Some of the questions were a little confusing for me to understand, but hopefully I answered them correctly. Overall, while Indiegogo doesn't provide a ton of services or have a lot of requirements  or qualifications for contributors, I think its a really cool company and that I can still make a decent company profile presentation for it. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> January 15, 2001 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Wikipedia developed from Nupedia, a free-online encyclopedia. The founders then had the idea to have users edit their own encyclopedia. <br />

<b>What services does Wikipedia provide?</b> Free encyclopedia then can be edited by users. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Nupedia <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> I have never updated an article, but I regularly use wikipedia to get a brief summary on any topic. I have always found the information to be of high quality(except in obscure topics). <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone can edit Wikipedia articles. <br />

<b>How does Wikipedia incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Wikipedia does not incentivize contributors. Contributors have identified the belief that knowledge should be free, values, and fun as motivation. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Wikipedia ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> New edits to Wikipedia are screened, and rollbacks to earlier versions are easy to perform. Biased users are also usually balanced by views from the other side, leading to neutral content remaining. Random users without accounts cannot make edits. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Wikipedia contributors also deal with the aggregation of the information provided by other contributors. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Contributors can edit most pages and the end user sees the edited page. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Wikipedia in terms of users?</b> 73,251 active users/ 22,437,253 accounts <br />

<b>What is the scale of Wikipedia in terms of dollars?</b> n/a <br />

<b>If Wikipedia were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> Because most of the quality/aggregation is done by the users, I think that the business model would work well if it was larger. This is assuming that the system isn't flooded with mostly malicious users. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does Wikipedia generate revenue?</b> Wikipedia is supported by the non-profit Wikimedia. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> January 15, 2001 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Not really. <br />

<b>What services does Wikipedia provide?</b> Wikipedia provides a free access online encyclopedia. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Other encyclopedias such as Encyclopedia Britannica. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> Anyone who is looking for information on a particular subject will use this service. I have used Wikipedia countless times, whether to learn about a new subject or for help with a concept I don't understand. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> Anyone can edit Wikipedia articles, as long as they have Internet and the capability to go to the Wikipedia site. However, only registered users can make new articles. Some articles are also semi-protected, meaning that only certain editors can make changes to the articles. <br />

<b>How does Wikipedia incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> The company does not do much to incentivize contributors. Contributors are purely volunteers who wish to improve the quality of information available on the site. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Wikipedia ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Wikipedia has a set of administrators and bureaucrats. Administrators are given the role of deleting incorrect material when they come across it, deleting unsuitable articles, and blocking disruptive users. Bureaucrats are given the role of appointing new administrators. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> Contributors can make edits to articles or post new articles. Other contributors can then continuously edit these articles until the community feels that all important information about the subject has been written. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is not really advertised, the contributors can freely make edits whenever they deem it necessary, and users get more accurate information in the end. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Wikipedia in terms of users?</b> 500 million <br />

<b>What is the scale of Wikipedia in terms of dollars?</b> Net Worth - 12.8 billion <br />

<b>If Wikipedia were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The incentive scheme is practically non-existent, yet people continue to contribute to the site. I would imagine that scaling the business would not change the percentage of people who contribute. The quality of contributions would most likely be worse initially, but would then plateau at where it is at now. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Non-profit organization <br />

<b>How does Wikipedia generate revenue?</b> Since Wikipedia is non-profit, it generates revenue solely through donations. Anybody who wishes to donate can, and single donations have reached as high as 2 million dollars. <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Casey Fenton, Daniel Hoffer, Sebastian Le Tuan and Leonardo Bassani da Silveira. <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> 2004 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> In 1999, co-founder Casey Fenton found a cheap flight from Boston to Iceland. Hoping to find similarly cheap accommodation, he randomly emailed 1500 students from the University of Iceland, asking if he could crash with them. He ultimately received 50 responses offering him a place to stay. He realized that people were open to the idea of sharing cross-cultural experiences in exchange for accommodation, and when he returned to the states he started intermittently working on code for a couchsurfing website. The Beta version of the site was launched in 2003, after the other co-founders joined the project, and today the site has over 9 million members in 120,000 cities. <br />

<b>What services does Couchsurfing provide?</b> Couchsurfing connects travelling Couchsurfers with hosts in the cities they will be travelling to. No money is exchanged for accommodation; rather, the expectation is that hosts and surfers will spend time together and learn more about each other's cultures. The website also facilitates short-term meetups between travelers and hosts, and several major cities have regular potlucks, language exchanges and other meet-ups to which all hosts residing in and all surfers passing through the area are invited to. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Couchsurfing provides a crowdsourcing tool that facilitates and streamlines the process of meeting a new friend in a new city who will welcome you into his or her home. Previously, this could be done by intrepid travelers who had the serendipity of meeting someone while travelling who they connected with, but Couchsurfing provides a means of turning strangers into new friends and facilitating cultural exchanges en masse.<p>It also updates and expands on previous free accommodation projects around the world, like that of the Tumbleweeds at the famed Shakespeare &amp; Co. bookstore in Paris. <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> 86% of CS's users are between 18 and 34, but as the network expands, the demographics are diversifying, and committed CS enthusiasts are maturing along with the network. Most people I have Couchsurfed with have been under 35. This group has included a wide range of people including&#58;<p>-A philosophy Ph.D student at the University of Edinburgh<p>-A Peruvian hotel receptionist in Rome who spoke 5 languages fluently and who welcomed me into his Mediterranean penthouse over the Christmas holidays<p>-Several businessman, ranging from the man tasked with expanding Marks &amp; Spencer from the UK into France to the man who coordinated all refrigerators of Ben &amp; Jerry's to a financial services professional who had worked in London, Zurich and now Paris<p>-A software programmer in Tallinn who described himself as like a cat who likes to meow sausages from strangers<p>-A completely blind 26-year-old in Ghent. We were his 123rd &amp; 124th CSers he had hosted and he said it was his way of giving back to a world that has been far too kind to him. <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> I think it's hard to distinguish whether or not someone is a contributor on CS--both surfers and hosts contribute in their own way, since the entire point of the network is to facilitate cross-cultural exchange.<p>Still, I suppose a more traditional definition of contributor would be whether or not someone hosts. Most people I have met who are surfers have also hosted at some point, though I've noticed that women surfers are more wary than men surfers of later becoming hosts. Some people are also super hosts, and have hosted hundreds of people. <br />

<b>How does Couchsurfing incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> For travelers, I think that the motivation for starting to use the network is that it's a great way to save money. But then once you get into it you realize it's also a great way to make friends and really get to know the local culture beyond what a guidebook can help you learn. Couchsurfing makes finding a new friend (or a group of friends) in each city you travel to easily, and if you read through each potential host's profile carefully and scrutinize their reviews, I find CS provides an excellent system of pairing surfers and hosts with people they will learn from and enjoy being around.<p>As for hosts, I have found that some get into hosting at times in their lives when they're lonely--when they have just been through a break-up or a divorce, or have just moved to a new city. That's not to say that CS is full of hosts who are mopey. Quite the contrary--it's full of hosts who are being brave and pushing themselves to branch out. Other hosts get into CS because they wish they had the opportunity to travel but they don't have the time to, and CS provides an excellent way of bringing the world to you. Others get into it because they have some extra space and are generous, curious people who are looking to make friends. <p>Once people get into CS, I think what keeps people coming back is that it restores your faith in humanity. There is a section on each member's profile where they're asked to list their opinion of the CS project, and I have seen countless reviews about how CS has opened their world, taught them that it can be okay to trust a stranger, and made the world seem like a more welcoming and less fearsome place. Many members will say things like CS could change the world. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Couchsurfing ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Couchsurfing's safety &amp; quality maintenance system is comprised of four parts&#58; references, verification, friends, and vouching.<p>-References are public reviews left for the surfer or host by friends and previous surfers, hosts, and fellow travelers. When leaving a review, an overall rating of positive, neutral or negative is assigned and then the reviewer can provide an in-depth account of his/her experience hosting, surfing with or travelling with that member. <p>-Verification, as explained above, occurs when the member pays a $25 fee to help support the community and has his/her location verified.<p>-Vouches are given by superhosts and CS Ambassadors to members who they are confident are assets to the community<p>-Friends are the final component. CS is a social network, and members can add friends who they have made both before and during their travels.<p>In addition to these features, CS offers a comprehensive menu of features that allow a user to report and messages or behavior that violates community standards. <p>A user's profile also provides a means of verification and quality control, as profiles with pictures that are thoroughly filled in offer overviews of each member's personality, language proficiencies, accommodation offerings, preferences, quirks, and dedication to the CS project and to travel. <br />


	<b>If Couchsurfing uses a reputation system, how does it work?</b> The reputation system is the basis of CS's security &amp; quality control&#58;<p>-References are public reviews left for the surfer or host by friends and previous surfers, hosts, and fellow travelers. When leaving a review, an overall rating of positive, neutral or negative is assigned and then the reviewer can provide an in-depth account of his/her experience hosting, surfing with or travelling with that member. <p>-Vouches are given by superhosts and CS Ambassadors to members who they are confident are assets to the community<p>-Friends are the final component. CS is a social network, and members can add friends who they have made both before and during their travels. <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> Roughly equal numbers <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> CS offers only general data on the impact that the project is having around the world, but it is clear that the impact of the project is spreading fast.<p>In places like Europe, it is relatively simple to string together a 30-45 day trip that will completely involve CS-ing. <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> The service is primarily advertised through word of mouth, and through the publicity it generates as people debate (with more or less open minds and with more or less experience with the project) in nationally syndicated publications whether or not it's safe to stay with strangers.<p>The contributors (hosts) offer a free place to stay for 1-X nights (usually 2-4 in my experience, but sometimes longer). Depending on the means of the host and what he/she wishes to do, they may also offer their surfers a simple breakfast, but this is not required. Very, very rarely have I merely slept on a couch--by far most hosts offer a spare bed or a futon, or at least have an air mattress for the floor. Hosts generally offer sheets, blankets and towels as well.<p>Surfers contribute by showing up, being friendly and curious, and making an effort to spend time with their host. Though at first blush many people see surfers as moochers, CS actually provides an amazing means of cultural exchange--members can practice their language skills with each other, and hosts get the chance to see their city from the eyes of their guests, and people get to make new friends from around the world and learn more about other countries and what people from other places think of their country. <br />

<b>What is the scale of Couchsurfing in terms of users?</b> 9000000 <br />

<b>What is the scale of Couchsurfing in terms of dollars?</b> $22.6 million <br />

<b>If Couchsurfing were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> I think this would work terribly. Since August 2012 the CS community has doubled in size, and one sad side effect is that more and more people are getting involved who see CS-ing as just a way of finding a place to stay for free. There is also the annoying problem of men (and maybe some women, though I haven't really heard of any) who misunderstand the network and think it is a way of facilitating hookups and easy sex. Thankfully, these spammy messages are easily filtered out and reportable.<p>CS is a place for wanderers, for the curious, and for travelers, not tourists. While I'm happy to see more and more wonderful and worthy people getting involved with the community, the expansion of the network's numbers also means that it is incumbent upon members to do more community policing of people who just don't get it. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Couchsurfing generate revenue?</b> There are two ways that CS generates revenue. Currently, the primary source is the investment money the company has raised from investors including General Catalyst Partners, Omidyar Network, and Menlo Ventures. $22.6 million has been raised from these streams in the past year. <p>The other source of CS's revenue is the $25 fee that members pay to become verified members. A card is sent to their home, and a code on the back, once entered into the CS system, confirms their location and verifies that they are a legitimate enough person to have a credit/debit card and that they have provided an accurate address. The verified member option is touted as a source of safety/security, and I find that more men become verified members than women because it's a way of increasing the trust that surfers and hosts will place in them. <br />


<b>Anything else?</b> I love CS and I hope that my presentation will convince more Penn students to join the network <br />

<b>Who were the founders?</b> Dennis Crowley, Naveen Selvadurai <br />

<b>When was it started?</b> March 11, 2009 <br />

<b>Does it have any interesting origin story?</b> Dodgeball was Dennis Crowley's first attempt at social networking for mobile phones and was acquired by Google in 2005.<p>When Google neglected the project, Crowley founded an improved location-based social game he named Foursquare.<p>Foursquare is based of the playground game, and is called such because it is supposed to be fun and playful. <br />

<b>What services does Foursquare provide?</b> Local search and recommendations&#58;<p>Foursquare lets you search for restaurants,shopping areas and other locations in your surrounding area. It is also possible to search other areas by entering the name of a remote location. <p>Users have the ability to 'Like' tips left by other users.Users can also save tips left by other users onto their own to do list, ensuring that the user is reminded about them when they are nearby, and can follow any other user or brand to increase the prominence of that user's tips when they are navigating Foursquare. <br />


	<b>If this updates a previous service or business model, what does it replace?</b> Magazines that provided reviews by only a handful of people <br />


<b>Who uses the services?</b> 1. Power Users -.  They spend inordinate amounts of time contributing to the website.  They might be moderating categories on Wikipedia, writing 100's of restaurant / bar reviews on Yelp, checking-in and commenting on ever Foursquare venue or even writing entire transcriptions of TV shows on ViiKii.net.  Or let's face it - writing lots of answers on Quora<p>2. Casual Contributors - These people are uninterested in achieving status on your website.  They had a very positive or negative experience and they want to tell the world.  They are passionate about a topic (like this one for me!) and they feel inclined to spend some time contributing.  <p>3. Lurkers.  Most UGC sites try to spend time converting lurkers to contributors.  Don't.  90% of all users will never contribute anything to your company.  They are there to ingest content.  <p><p><p> <br />

<b>Who are the people who contribute the services?</b> The users and contributors come from the same groups of people.<p>However the contributors can also be restaurants and local set ups.<p>For example&#58; he may advertise a free good for the mayor(a foursquare member) of the region. <br />

<b>How does Foursquare incentivize them to contribute, or what is their motivation?</b> Social Responsibility is the primary motivation behind public reviews and tips.This builds social capital. People with a good experience want to share their positive feedback as it is convenient for others. <br />

<b>Is this a service that was previously provided by experts?</b>  Yes. 
<br />

<b>Are the contributors experts/professionals?</b>  No. 
<br />

<b>How does Foursquare ensure the quality of the services it provides?</b> Foursquare tries to ensure the privacy of its users.Privacy is integral to a company like foursquare.<p>Foursquare's Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we'll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others <br />



<b>Compare the number of users to contributors:</b> More users than contributors <br />

<b>If its service is provided by many contributors, how are their contributions aggregated?</b> The reviews are aggregated and maintained with a reference to people tastes and preferences.<p>It also records attributes such as price range, friends preferences etc.<p> <br />

<b>Describe the workflow for how the service is advertised, how the contributors contribute, and what the users get in the end:</b> Most users access Foursquare with an application loaded on their smartphones, but it's also possible to update the service on your movements through the Foursquare Web site or by sending a text message. After you have signed up for a free account on the company's Web site and installed the application on your phone, you can activate the program any time you visit a location. Foursquare accesses your phone's GPS receiver to pinpoint your position and then lists nearby locations. After you choose which place you are visiting, the application updates your status to let other users know. If you update your status at the same location enough times, you can even earn badges or become the mayor of that location. Users can also use the location information to plan face-to-face meetings <br />

<b>What is the scale of Foursquare in terms of users?</b> 50 million <br />

<b>What is the scale of Foursquare in terms of dollars?</b> 15 million <br />

<b>If Foursquare were to scale up to 10-100 times its current size, how well do you think would its business model would work?</b> The business model would only succeed further because such applications have enormous network externality. i.e. as each additional individual joins<p>the value of the application to all the existing users.<p>Especially if users come from new markets. <br />

<b>What kind of organization is it?</b> Privately held company <br />

<b>How does Foursquare generate revenue?</b> Advertisments <br />
