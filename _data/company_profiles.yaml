  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.mealku.com/<p>http://www.jamieoliver.com/us/foundation/jamies-food-revolution/news-content/mealku-sharing-homemade-meals-online<p>http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/leftovers-made-to-share-with-strangers/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1<p>http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577500800856082254<p>http://www.today.com/food/do-you-mealku-potluck-craze-sweeps-home-kitchens-1C8613219<p>http://analisfirstamendment.blogspot.com/2012/08/interview-with-ted-dcruz-young-founder.html
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Nope.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Meal co-op for exchanging homemade meals within your city.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.mealku.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: July 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Ted D'Cruz-Young
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not really. I young hippie do-gooder kind of founder who wanted to come up with an organization to promote eating healthy, local food and reduce food waste. The founder also started a marketing agency called Ideocracy.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Mealku is basically a middleman that helps its members exchange food. Since there is no cost to receiving food, Mealku tracks points so that members have to put into the co-op (usually by providing food, but also by providing reviews and being active on the site) in order to receive food from the co-op. It also provides bicycle deliverymen and storage containers to transport the food from cook to consumer.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Fast food deliver/take-out. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.eatwith.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Health- and environment-conscious urban people. They say the goal is to make healthy food affordable, but it looks like you need a decent amount of cooking time and space in order to cook for other people, so I would imagine that most of the users are middle class. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users and the contributors are the same crowd. You have to provide food in order to receive food. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People don't join unless they want to provide food. It is as much a community of hippie foodies as it is a way of getting free meals.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Kitchen inspections, user reviews, and peer pressure.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: The gov't doesn't currently regulate food exchanges that are not monetary. Mealku makes an effort to check that the cooks' kitchens are not cesspools of waste, but it mostly operates on the trust system. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Users can rate the meals they receive, both using a star system over several criteria (food quality, portion size, etc) and by leaving free form comments. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: You only get points if others sign up to receive your food, and you can't receive food if you don't have points, so the crowd can end up filtering out the people who are making poor contributions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: ~1500 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Not very well. It depends on a local, trust-based community. It could probably scale well to many local organizations in many different cities, like a franchise model.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Users sign up, pay a monthly fee to cover deliver and packaging. Then they post meals they intend to cook (about 3 days before they intend to do so). If people sign up to receive those meals (paying points to do so) then the cook prepares them as promised, a Mealku delivery biker comes to their house with to pick up the packaged food, and brings it to the person who ordered it. The person who ordered can review the cook online afterward. The cook receives points for having provided food.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Some articles touch on the possible health and safety concerns, but it is not large enough to have attracted serious concerns. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They don't. It is a co-op, so they just need to stay afloat.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Kaggle
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle<p>http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/03/kaggle<p>http://theminingbook.blogspot.com/2014/03/kaggle-matches-companies-and-analysts.html<p>http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/industry/big-data<p>http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014018/the-rise-of-the-diy-data-scientist<p>http://www.wired.com/2011/12/kaggle/<p>http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kaggle
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.kaggle.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2010
  who_were_the_founders: Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founder, Anthony Goldbloom won an essay contest with The Economist and did a three month internship in the Finance and Economics Section. Here, he was writing about big data and in the process came up with the idea behind Kaggle. After the internship he taught himself to code at night and eventually created Kaggle 1.0.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Kaggle offers a a framework for the competition, consulting service for the host to prepare the data and the description of the problem, anonymize the data, and integrate the winning model into their operations.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces tech consulting firms since through this platform, even companies without internal data science teams can come up with predictive models for the problems they had.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: CrowdANALYTIX<p>DataKind
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Researchers and organizations like NASA, Microsoft, Heritage Provider Network use this service. An example would be NASA's cosmological image analysis competition for mapping dark matter. Here, the participants were provided with images of 100,000 galaxy and star pairs, then based on the tiny distortions in the images, they were to provide an estimate for the ellipticity for each galaxy.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Students and data scientists from over 100 countries and 200 universities. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Prize money and test data are some incentives. Some people use Kaggle to meet, learn, network and collaborate with experts from related fields.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: n some senses, the service provided is self-regulated in terms of quality. Since the incentivize structure is set up as a competition, there would really be no point in entering the competition if you aren't going to make an honest attempt at the problem. It is technically possible that all the data scientists could collude, submit bogus solutions, and split the prize amongst themselves without doing any real work, but considering a large part of the incentive structure has to do with the challenge and glory of the competitions, this is not very likely.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Kaggle users are allocated points for their performance in competitions. The overall user rankings are then shown on their website. Kaggle also separates its users into 3 tiers - novice, Kaggler, and master. Each tier is demarcated by a different color profile.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Kaggle presents problems in competition form, so many teams compete against one another to come up with the best solution to the problem. Although the teams are competing against one another, Kaggle is a way for some of the top minds to collaborate with others from all over the world, and the forum on Kaggle provides a great way for knowledge- and idea-sharing to take place.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 200,000 data scientists (contributors); at any time, there will be around 10-15 competitions (hosted by users)
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Up to $3 million in prize money
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Our initial thought was that, because a decent proportion of the Kagglers are Ph.D.'s, there would be an upper limit to the number of Kagglers that could be drawn in join these competitions. However, upon further research, one article revealed that the typical competition winner on Kaggle is self-taught. With this in mind, and given the potential generous size of the prizes (up to $300 an hour) and the "fun" aspect of the competitions, we feel that Kaggle's ability to attract the necessary talent to solve these problems would scale up quite well without sacrificing quality of the data scientists. Similarly, given the rise of "big data" and the associated need for data analysis, we feel that the number of companies and institutions funding these projects, and hence the incentive scheme, would similarly scale up well (more projects, more available prize money). Another point to make is that a lot of the scientists are incentivized by the challenge and the glory Kaggle presents (as opposed to the money), all of which would remain (if not intensify) if Kaggle were to scale up.None that we are aware of
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When a company/institution has a predictive data problem they would like solved, they can create a simplified (or not) version of the problem and create a competition for it, offering a prize of their choosing for the winner. The competition is then posted on the competition board on Kaggle, where the contributors (Kagglers) can choose to tackle the problem by forming teams and signing up for the competition. Each team's ranking is tracked in real-time throughout the duration of the competition, and when the time for the competition is up, the winning team gets awarded whatever prize was offered, and each user is rewarded his/her respective points for completing the competition.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: None that we are aware of
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kaggle charges a fixed fee to those hosting the competitions and also gets a proportion of prize money.

  give_a_url_for_the_companys_logo: http://bornski.com/matt/quirky.png
  what_company_are_you_profiling: Quirky
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: https://www.quirky.com/how-it-works<p>many sub-sites of quirky.com<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/technology/quirky-hopes-wink-will-speed-adoption-of-smart-home-products.html?_r=0
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I contributed to an invention - I shared my views on pricing of several already-pitched ideas. I very nearly ordered a fancy cutting board, then remembered that I am a college student and cook something gourmet about once per semester. 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Quirky crowdsources idea generation for new inventions, evaluation of that idea's feasibility and quality, and then manufactures and sells those inventions on their site.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.quirky.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Ben Kaufman
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Quirky arose when the founder's first business attempts at 18 years old failed miserably. He later decided that he could make invention and entrepreneurship more accessible by providing the platform for manufacturing, pricing, and sale - bringing the ideas of others to life. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: For inventors, they pay for the genius of the crowd - they take your idea, let other people vote to determine the best, use a crowd of experts to select one each week for manufacture, then use non-experts to determine price points and decide design questions. Their employees manufacture it. <p>For consumers, they sell devices that improve life in some way - modular power strips solve the problem of large plug-ins blocking other ports, internet-connected piggy banks make saving money trackable and fun, and a plethora of cord and desk organizers, among many others. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It's a smaller-scale incubator, where the inventor isn't expected to have technical skills or marketing prowess. Quirky takes in an idea, uses people to evaluate its merit, then makes and sells it based on price points provided by the crowd. <p>What makes Quirky unique is that it pays people to be influencers rather than simply inventors - no other site incorporates the crowd so well. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: SeedStudio Wishes<p>RocketHub<p>GeniusCrowds<p>Nest<p>KickStarter<p>IndieGoGo<p>EdisonNation
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Anyone, from a suburban mom to a seasoned patent-holder, could pitch an idea for an invention - their bare minimum is a one-sentence description, not a technical write-up or elevator pitch. Anyone, anywhere, can "influence" the inventions by deciding details on it or voting for the highest-quality ideas. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: There are no limitations or criteria preventing anyone from contributing, in an inventor or influencer role. In practice, inventors seem to be younger people who have encountered a problem repeatedly. There is no data released on influencers. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The company pays inventors - the people who pitch the original idea - 4.2% of the revenue of the product, assuming the product is manufactured and sold. It is easier to be an influencer; you can weigh in on design and price details of a product that is guaranteed to be rolled out, though of course your contribution is much less. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Interestingly, at Quirky the crowd regulates itself via a voting system for ideas. However, there is involvement from experts (retailers, manufacturers, marketers) when, each Thursday night, the company meets and picks the next idea to manufacture. People weigh in on design concerns, and at the end of the night, the physical crowd (mixed between experts and non-experts) votes on whether or not they will manufacture something. If more than half of the crowd votes yes, the founder has committed to moving it to production. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Typically, the government would protect the interests of investors by providing some type of intellectual property right. Quirky does not give credit to investors, but rather purchases the rights to an idea if they decide to use it, passing a share of the revenue along to the investor. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: N/A
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Contributions are aggregated via a simple majority. The most votes for non-quantitative options and the simple mean for quantitative options determine design specifications and prices, even product names. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Quirky has nearly one million contributors, and has released 344 products since 2009.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Quirky has projected $100 million in earnings in 2014.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: It would likely work better the larger the crowd becomes. There would be more ideas proposed, and, assuming patient and thorough voters, the best would rise to the top, where a larger crowd would ensure better price points, names, and color choices. The quality would improve and Quirky would likely benefit from an even larger customer base. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service does not seem to be advertised on any external sites, only on the shopping portal itself. If you decide to "invent," you are brought to a form to describe your idea. Once that is completed, "influencers" can vote to indicate their favorite design ideas. Then the Quirky team decides whether or not they will produce it, at which point influencers can vote for design specifications, name, prices, etc. <p>Both inventors and influencers receive a fraction of the revenue if Quirky decides to produce it. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I want to work for them! In a real, employee-type-way, not as an influencer. Being an inventor would be cool too. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: According to an anonymous forum site, they promise to pay inventors 40%, but in reality only pay 4.2% of revenue. This is probably because they also compensate influencers. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company sells the devices after they are pitched, assessed, priced, and designed by the crowd. Quirky manufactures the devices, sometimes for sale on their website, sometimes in partnership with retail giants like Home Depot.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No, although I've used its service before.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Netflix is a media business, mainly focused on renting DVDs and unlimitedly streaming movies and TV shows.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.netflix.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 1997
  who_were_the_founders: Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Supposedly, Hastings came up with the idea for Netflix when he was charged $40 for late fees on a very late copy of Apollo 13. <p>(**ppt&#58; Hastings got charged $40 for late fees - wasn't happy **)
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Internet video streaming and disc rental.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: They started with only an online disc rental service, which was pay per rental. After this, they added a subscription based service. From there, they drop the pay per rental and progressed to the internet streaming later on.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The company Quickflix is an Australian company of similar design, focusing on online movie rentals and their distribution<p>The company GameFly, which was modeled after Netflix, is similar except for online video games instead of movies.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: People of all ages, including families and students will use this in lieu of going to their local rental movie place (which are all but nonexistent anymore). I've personally used this service to catch up on old TV series and watch movies that I either haven't seen before, or wanted to watch on a whim, opposed to planning a whole movie night and segmenting time to go and pick up a movie from BlockBuster or a RedBox. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The contributers of the service are the same people who purchase subscriptions to Netflix and watch the movies and TV shows
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: They are incentived not explicitly, but rather implicity by the results of the contributions. People's recommendations help rank what movies they enjoy, and help Netflix give suggestions for movies or shows they would probably like to see.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Controversially, they have purchased "highways" of bandwidth, partnering with certain internet providers, so that their streaming service won't be interrupted or hampered.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: They are aggragated according to an algorithm. This algorithm has changed a lot in recent years, and Netflix even offered a $1,000,000 prize to a person/team who could up with an algorithm that beats their current one by 10% for guessing what TV shows and movies people would watch.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: On the order of 50 million users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: The operating income is $228 million where the total assets are $5.4 billion.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Netflix is primarily an English site, showing English movies, with the option of other languages subtitles as well as some small selection of foreign movies. Therefore, to scale up by 10 times, to ~500 million users, would hit the limit of English speakers of the world (currently ~430 million), so they would be limited by that factor. Their incentive scheme is already scaled to such a high number, that I don't believe it needs scaling, although the quality and aggregation model might need to adapt to more worldwide users, especially where people come from different cultures, even if speaking English, and consider how it may affect their contributions.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised heavily through internet ads, commercial TV ads, as well as word of mouth. Contributors contribute by rating a movie or show on a 5 star system through the site, prompted after they watch it. Users in the end get an aggregation from other users of the popularity of certain movies and how that might relate to their preferences. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: They've had some contoversies about throttling of DvDs, perhaps "unfairly" buying out of the highway lanes of the internet in order to provide their service quickly, as well as some social media support that they later dropped.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: They generate revenue through the subscriptions of their customers.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I am an active contributor to the site.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Stack Overflow is a crowdsourced question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.stackoverflow.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Stack Overflow was created as a crowdsourced alternative to earlier Q&A sites like Experts Exchange. Interestingly enough, the name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, founder Atwood's popular programming blog. As the primary purpose of the site was to help programmers solve and help each other with mainly technical programming issues, the terms ‘stack' and ‘overflow' can be put together to loosely mirror ‘memory overflow' in meaning!
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The main purpose of stack overflow is to provide a forum for the online programming community to get together and discuss technical aspects across a wide range of programming languages and structures in an interactive and open Q&A format. The site has users who post both queries and answers and moderators who monitor postings and bulletins.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Stack Overflow is used primarily by programmers working in nearly every kind of possible programming language or environment to troubleshoot problems, offer solutions to other problems in the community and to participate in finding answers in the field of computer science and programming. Each user first logs in with a free account and can then post queries that need answering and can provide working solutions and explanations to other ongoing query resolutions. Active members earn reputation points which make their answers more reputable.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The users are the contributors.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: By answering questions and getting solutions voted up by other community members on the site, contributors are encouraged to use Stack Overflow and improve their online reputation and coding profile. Special badges and achievements on the site profile can be unlocked, which leads to a very highly viewed profile that can be linked or referred to on other sites on the internet.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: As the website is all about ‘finding answers' the quality of the answers is collectively assessed by the ‘crowd' of users actively participating in the community, through vote ups or vote downs and through reputation points. There are moderators who routinely run searches through threads to check for duplicated questions/old unanswered questions etc, but majority of quality control is user judged.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Yes, users earn reputation points for their Stack Overflow account profiles (which show up on each question posted or answered). This raises the repute of high point-earners, making their answers much more reliable than beginners. There are also special badges and achievements which can be unlocked and added to the profile.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Multiple users can provide answers to the same question/query. However, by the process of voting up the most relevant/accurate/efficient answer, the website crowdsources the process of ranking questions. All answers are shown by default, but higher voted up answers are shown first.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: In 2012 they had over 175,000 users, the global	site ranking is currently 49 and its 51 in the US.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Their revenue is not listed publicly because it is a privately held company.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think the incentive scheme would scale well, as long as Stack Overflow Careers could grow accordingly. With more users the quality would be even better, because there would be more feedback on the quality of the questions and answers. The only problem might be if there were not a balanced amount of questions and people answering questions.<p>
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: They don't delete repetitive posts, so there are a lot of keywords on the site, leading to it being at the top of search engine hits. Unanswered questions are listed under a tab on the homepage of the site, making it easy for people to answer questions. Contributors and users are the same people, and they answer and ask questions for the goal of sharing information.<p>

  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: No
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held website
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Stack Overflow is a part of Stack Exchange which is an online package framework for a multitude of websites and they all generate revenue through ad listings on the website in strategic locations on the page - such as between questions and answers and next to question lists. In addition, Stack Overflow displays job positions and career options from external partner companies (mostly in the computer programming sector) which also add to the total revenue stream.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I contacted the office and the Press Contact.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: CrowdMed uses crowdsourcing to collaboratively solve even the world's most difficult medical cases quickly and accurately online. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.crowdmed.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2013
  who_were_the_founders: Jared Heyman, Jessica Greenwalt, and Leonardo Setyano
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: From the website&#58; "After nearly three frustrating years, Carly was desperate for answers. She was clearly suffering from a serious medical condition, but nearly two dozen doctors, countless medical tests and over $100,000 in medical bills still could not tell her what was wrong. Carly had once been a vibrant, healthy teenager, but now she could barely get out of bed. Her symptoms and the emotional stress were pushing her and her family to the breaking point.<p>Finally, after a rare opportunity to consult with a top-notch interdisciplinary team of medical experts from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Carly received an answer&#58; "Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency" (FXPOI) - a rare genetic mutation found in just one of every 15,000 people. Even more astounding, the treatment of Carly's condition involved a simple hormone patch, which effectively eliminated all of her symptoms in less than one month.<p>Prior to her diagnosis, Carly was starting to wonder whether her life was already over. Today, Carly is fully recovered, with a new family of her own, and she is actively achieving all of her personal and professional goals."<p>Carly's medical mystery took nearly three years, two dozen doctors, and more than $100,00 in medical bills to diagnose.Her case was eventually solved after she had a rare opportunity to meet with a large, interdisciplinary team of top-notch medical experts - who all collaborated and worked together, and remained focused on the case for as long as it took to reach a consensus-based diagnosis.Thus, her brother, Jared Heyman, was inspired to start CrowdMed.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: CrowdMed uses crowdsourcing and patented prediction market technology to diagnose rare conditions that doctors could easily miss, as well as offering “second opinions” to patients who may be unsure of the accuracy of their stated diagnosis. CrowdMed's patented technology uses the collective knowledge, intelligence, and unbiased opinions of thousands of “Medical Detectives” to present an accurate list of a patient's most probably diagnoses, sometimes in a matter of hours. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: This service doesn't really replace the practice of health specialists and online health forums, but it does help in finding solutions faster and easier. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: http://www.patientslikeme.com/<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Rip Heminway did a lot of running, soccer, back-country skiing, and white water kayaking. However, he started losing mobility and getting chronic pain. He said that a specialist would give him a list of different htings they think it might be, but never any kind of concrete clarity around what the problem was. He ended up spending thousands of dollars on specialists, blood tests, lab results, and the like. When he got his report from CrowdMed, he got a whole series of diagnoses which gave him a great foundation to work from. CrowdMed provided him to find succinct information. He is now pain-free and fully functional.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: While most of the Medical Detectives are active in medicine, others might not be doctors but do have first-hand experience with specific medical conditions. CrowdMed has proven that many kinds of people can help solve medical mysteries - including researchers, students, and even former patients.<p>
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: CrowdMed uses a point-based system to track Medical Detective performance and reward our community appropriately. By maximizing their point earnings, Medical Detectives can improve their ranking and reputation, earn the recognition of their peers, and even earn cash compensation offered by patients. Most importantly, Medical Detectives help patients get their lives back, which provides a sense of personal satisfaction in itself. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: CrowdMed uses a patented prediction market algorithm to assign probabilities to each diagnostic or solution suggestion based upon our Medical Detectives' background and behavior. They look for the most probable solutions, not just the most popular ones.<p>CrowdMed has devoted several years to develop patented prediction market methods to filter out any "noise" from all the input, to produce a report that highlights the top diagnostic and solution suggestions from the highest ranked Medical Detectives, which have the most confidence within the community.<p>Medical Detectives assign points to indicate their confidence in the suggestions offered to your case - a key component to the success and accuracy of the service. The points system requires people to prove their confidence, rather than just assume they're correct.<p>
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: n/a
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Cases are active for 30 days unless extended by the patient. At the end of this period, patients are asked to review the results with their physician and select the best diagnostic and solution suggestions. Medical Detectives who contributed to these suggestions are awarded points, status, and even cash compensation from those patients offering it - but the greatest reward for most of our Medical Detectives is knowing they've helped people get their lives back.<p>“Detective Rating System”. This system assigns a score to each Medical Detective on a 1-10 scale, which is expressed as their DetectiveRating (e.g., DR6). Inspired by Google's PageRank system, our DetectiveRating system provides a variable opinion weighting and special privileges to those Medical Detectives who perform the best on our site. For example, only DR6's and above can assign points on diagnostic and solution suggestions on cases offering cash compensation, thus influencing their probability rankings. Note, a peer rating from a DR8 carries twice as much weight as one from a DR4.<p><p>
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Cases are active for 30 days. When a case is posted, Medical Detectives provide well-researched and evidence-based diagnostic suggestions for patients to confirm with their doctors by posting them to the case. At the end of this process, contributions are aggregated, and the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solution,along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Information not available. Called the office and they said they could not disclose information not on the website.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars:  In 2013 they received $1.1 million in seed funding.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If the company were to scale up to 10 or 100 times its current size, I think that its business model would still work. The current quality/aggregation model would work even for bigger sizes; however, there may possibly be a need to better categorize cases if the number of cases significantly increases in order to help Medical Detectives better find the cases they would most likely be familiar with. The reputation model of the Medical Detectives may also change to put more emphasis on the professional credentials of the Detectives in addition to their contribution to the site. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When a case is posted, Medical Detectives have the chance to provide input for the case. Medical Detectives may also use chat and discussion features to ask questions, request additional details, and discuss your case. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a report which includes the top diagnostic suggestions and solutions, along with supporting medical references and explanations from the community.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I think that this company has a great idea; I'm surprised that there are no other companies just like it. CrowdMed does a great job providing information to those who may not have access to it; however, the quality of the obtained information must be carefully assessed. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: At the moment there are no public controversies about the company. However, I feel like there could be controversies contributors could fake their credentials or provide misleading diagnoses. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: In terms of revenue, the company is currently charging a 10 percent commission on all cash rewards offered by patients for accurate diagnoses.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: FiveThirtyEight (538)
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://fivethirtyeight.com/<p>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/upshot-vox-fivethirtyeight-data-journalism-golden-age<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight<p>http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Tried the company's service - navigated though the website and read posted articles
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: FiveThiryEight is a poll aggregator and data analysis website and blog.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://fivethirtyeight.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: March 7, 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Nate Silver
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The website was launched and quickly gained prominence during the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. 538 (at the time consisting of only founder Nate Silver) was unique in its approach to predicting the outcomes of primary elections, using a model based mainly on demographic information and past results in other states, rather than polls, to predict outcomes. In many cases, this model was more accurate than the traditional poll-based model, garnering significant attention for the site throughout the election cycle and beyond.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The site produces statistical analysis and blog content covering a wide range of subject matter. Most prominently, the site produces statistically modeled predictions for upcoming elections using polls published by other outlets and various other data. Other content categories include Sports, Economics, Science, and Life. In a typical post, a data-driven approach is taken to providing insight into a particular topic. For example, one of today's main features is "America's Best Burrito", the last of a series of articles in which burrito shops from across the country (chosen based on Yelp data and "expert" opinions) have been scored using a prescribed methodology and a winner picked using a bracket-style competition. The feature focuses not only on burritos, but also on the reliability and usefulness of crowdsourced data found on sites like Yelp.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: As a poll aggregator, 538 is similar to many services before it, including such companies as Real Clear Politics and the Princeton Election Consortium. Unlike these sites, 538 offers significant non-political content on top of its poll aggregation services.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The Upshot<p>Vox<p>First Look Media
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The service is meant for readers of all backgrounds who are seeking interesting and new insights into topics with which they are already familiar. The website is well designed, visually appealing, and easy to use. Much of the content is interactive, with infographics and charts which are click-able and customizable.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Contributors to 538 are its data sources and the site's staff of writers and data analysts. Data sources include various polls published by other (sometimes competing) publications. 538 has received criticism for its lack of transparency about the way in which its gathered polling data is used in its models.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: FiveThirtyEight collects data by paying for it or gathering it from its publication on other sites. Thus, not all "contributors" to 538 necessarily do so willingly or knowingly.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: When polling, FiveThirtyEight uses large sampling pools and then applies several mathematical adjustments to these sampling pools to ensure the accuracy of its numbers.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: N/A
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: N/A
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: FiveThirtyEight accumulates polling data from several polls and then calculates an adjusted score based on these parameters (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pollster-ratings-v40-methodology/).
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: The total number of users of 538's services is the number of readers which is not reported.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Scaling 538 to 10 or 100 times its size would not largely affect the business model. The company would require more employees to run statistical analyses, but because 538 compiles data rather than collects it, the business model would not be as other companies' who depend on data collection.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: FiveThirtyEight uses other polls and does not directly crowdsource.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 538 was not a perfect match for many of these questions because it uses data differently than many other consumer data-dependent companies. 538 does not directly generate revenue from its customers and thus cares less about their spending behavior. Obviously, 538 wants to increase its number of readers, but 538 has access to less consumer data because there are no transactions between 538 and its customers.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: 538 and Nate Silver came under fire for its lack of transparency regarding how it ranks its pollsters. This led Silver to publishing an article detailing its methods for adjusting the rankings of its pollsters.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: FiveThirtyEight generates revenue by selling advertisements on its webpage. In the past, revenue was also generated by "licensing" content to be published elsewhere, notable by the New York Times from 2010 to 2013.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kiva is a not-for-profit microfinance platform that allows moneylenders around the world to empower entrepreneurs with just $25
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.kiva.org
  when_was_the_company_started: October 2005
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Flannery and Jessica Jackley
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Kiva was started by the couple Jessica Jackley and Matt Flannery. A lecture by Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, was a call to tap into the power of micro lending. They spearheaded Kiva with entrepreneurs in Kenya, who struggled to get past the lack-of-captial hump. The company's name means 'unity' in Swahili.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: They provide a service to local entrepreneurs, field partners, and individual lenders. Their 'social service' is provide entrepreneurs with a platform to accumulate funding. Kiva field partners--who can be microfinance institutions, nonprofits, schools, and social businesses--upload information about entrepreneurs onto Kiva. The field partners handle the disbursement of the funds raised on Kiva to the entrepreneur, who will pay them back with interest in time. Individual lenders are provided a simple, nearly net-zero way to support social projects--the money they contribute to entrepreneurs is paid back as Kiva credit to give to a new loan.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Kiva is an revolutionary add-on to typical microfinancing efforts. Not only does it organize and validate the loans disbursed by microfinance institutions, Kiva enables other organizations to become established microfinancers. This includes schools, non profits, and social enterprises, who all interface with a wealth of worthy entrepreneurs.<p>It 'recycles' loan money by crowdsourcing. Small donations by lenders accumulate into loans that the field partners can disburse. The entrepreneur still gets their funding, the field partner collects the same interest on the loan as usual, but the lender gets paid back in credit and the money can be reused more efficiently.<p>
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: United Prosperity (http://www.unitedprosperity.org/) - Kiva equivalent<p>Zidisha (https://www.zidisha.org/) - alternative to Kiva that connects lenders to borrowers directly, without using loan officers<p>Grameen Foundation (http://www.grameenfoundation.org/), Accion (http://www.accion.org/) - provides financial services to the poor<p>GlobalGiving (http://www.globalgiving.org/) - supports social entrepreneurs and non-profits<p>Vittana (http://www.vittana.org/) - microfinancing student loans 
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: As a lender (an average person browsing the internet to do social good), you 1)Sign up as a kiva lender, 2)Browse borrower profiles and choose someone to lend to 3)Get paid back in Kiva credit and start again @ #2
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Based on a January 31, 2013, survey by Kiva (“Kiva Lender Demographics for Kiva Field Partners”), Kiva lenders are 2/3 female and 1/3 male. About 67% of lenders are 35 or older, while about 20% of lenders are 25 - 34 years old. Over 60% of Kiva lenders have a college degree. Approximately 60% of Kiva lenders live in the United States. The rankings by total amount lent per country are as follows&#58; United States (49.96%), Western Europe (14.33%), Canada (6.64%), Australia (3.05%), Asia Pacific (1.71%), Middle East / North Africa (0.34%), Central America / Caribbean (0.22%), South America (0.13%), Central and South Asia (0.09%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (0.05%). 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: As stated in the above report, these are the most common motivations for people who lend on Kiva&#58;<p>● A method of helping other people. <p>● A way to share their personal good fortune with others. <p>● A way to help an individual improve their social and economic standing. <p>● A window to the world, allowing a lender to become exposed to different people and cultures. <p>● A way to connect with, or give back to, a region where they have traveled or lived. <p>● A way for a lender to help an individual who shares common characteristics to themselves (age, gender, family size/structure, profession, etc.). <p>Additionally, Kiva often releases timed incentives such as, “Donate in the next two days and have your donation matched,” to further encourage lending activity.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: They review profiles of potential borrowers before posting them as eligible to receive a loan. This is a good filtration system to keep the projects listed social impact-guaranteed.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Many countries regulate the microfinance industry to prevent fraud, protect consumers, and stabilize financial markets. Regulations change from country to country; for example, the Reserve Bank of India requires that loans made to non-government microfinance institutions have a minimum term of 3 years. Kiva has found ways to work within these regulations by holding on to repaid loans for 3 years before sending repayments back to lenders. Other countries, such as Ecuador, impose interest rate caps and/or extra taxes on internationally-funded microfinance organizations; these regulations directly impact Kiva's field partners, who must find ways to comply. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: They allow individual lenders to join Lending Teams, which give towards different loans as a group. Kiva puts up a Leaderboard for Lending Teams, which displays top giver and how much they've giving total. Currently, I see Kiva Christians and Carnegie Mellon on the Leaderboard.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: An international network of 274 (as of September 8, 2014) microfinance organizations screens borrowers, posts loan requests to Kiva, disburses loans to borrowers, and collects repayments from borrowers. When a lender makes a loan, Kiva delivers the funds to the local Field Partner, who then takes charge of loan administration.<p>
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: As of September 8, 2014, there are 1,219,715 active lenders on Kiva who have funded 1,409,460 borrowers. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: As of September 8, 2014, there has been $607,594,600 made in loans.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Yes, The incentive--your money is paid back to you to give again--will always be a component of the Kiva model, even at a huge scale. The quality of the user experience could go down, if  it becomes impossibly hard to search for a great loan and some entrepreneurs never receive funds. (The amount of lender) * (the average amount of money they give) must always be nearly equal to the total amount of money that all loans on Kiva are asking for.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Kiva advertises 4 simple steps for lenders&#58; 1)choose a borrower 2)make a loan 3)get repaid 4)repeat! The contributors give in step #2 via a secure transaction through PayPal. The users, the field partners, gain the ability to facilitate a loan without putting up all the capital for it. They crowdfund the money through Kiva for their entrepreneur and get paid back by the entrepreneur with the same amount of interest.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: I think they're wonderful. I'm very curious who their first supporters were, because they have a web interface that's top of the line and obviously required some serious initial investments. There have been a few corrupt field partners, and the model they present isn't entirely honest (they distribute funds to the borrower before publicly posting their profile), but they get the job of microfinancing done with more efficiency and less uncertainty than has traditionally been seen. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Kiva, like many microfinance and charitable organizations, has had its share of transparency problems. A post on NextBillion.net dated February 10, 2014, entitled “The Kiva Fairytale” alleged that Kiva had “zero overall impact (on a good day).” The author attacked Kiva's claims of being a peer-to-peer lending service (as in reality, loans backstop pre-existing loans at microfinance institutions), cast doubts on the integrity of its partner banks, and accused Kiva of overall “deliberate deception.” Kiva's co-founder and CEO subsequently responded to these allegations. Additionally, Kiva launched Kiva Zip in 2011, which functions as a direct peer-to-peer microloan service between the United States and Kenya. Premal Shah, Kiva's president, calls this service “the future of Kiva.”<p>As a side note, a month-long study of Kiva donor activities published March 2012 found that lenders tend to strongly favor female borrowers and those they considered “more attractive, lighter-skinned, and less obese.” 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kiva is entirely dependent upon donations. For every loan they make, lenders are encouraged to donate an additional few dollars directly to Kiva&#58; “The majority of Kiva donations are provided by our lenders, who ‘tip' us on top of the loans they make to borrowers. … A large majority of the rest of our donation income is provided by foundations, who encourage us to create innovative programs to serve the poor more effectively (e.g. Google.org funding of Kiva Labs).”

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Woot (shirt.woot specifically)
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: shirt.woot.com,<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot#Bibliography,<p>http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y10/m07/i01/s01,<p>http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/woot,<p>http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/woot-amazon/
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I have bought a couple shirts from shirt.woot, and I can vouch for the quality, ease of purchase, and speed of delivery.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Shirt.woot, a sub-site of the company woot (with the tagline “One day, one deal”), holds a weekly contest for users to submit t-shirt designs, where other users vote on the designs they like best, and the winner goes on sale for a discounted price.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: shirt.woot.com
  when_was_the_company_started: Woot was founded on July 12, 2004, but shirt.woot was started until July 2007
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Rutledge
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Woot began in 2004, but quickly branched into it's first sub-site wine.woot, which offers daily deals on wine that they will ship to your home.  Then came shirt.woot, which utilized the user voting schema.  After branching off into even more sub-sites (kids.woot, deals.woot, computers.woot, tools.woot, electronics.woot, etc.) woot was acquired in 2010 by Amazon for an estimated $110,000,000.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It is an Internet retailer.  It provides a community of artists and consumers, and allows amateur artists to release works to be reviewed by the community.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Threadless
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: In my personal experience, I subscribe to the email listserv, which sends out the one deal per day.  If I like the design, then I have a limited time to buy the shirt before it either goes up in price, or runs out of stock.<p>Another use one might have would be that of an amateur artist.  As an artist, you can submit designs for free.  Have them be reviewed and commented on by peers in the community.  And if you win, you can garnish $1000 plus $2 per shirt sold after the first day.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Amateur artists submit designs for the weekly derby, and professional artists submit designs to shirt.woot's staff picks.  T-shirt buyers and artists vote on designs to decide what eventually gets printed and sold on the site.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Artists are motivated by the love of art, $1,000 for a top 3 position along with $2 for every unit sold after the first day.  Users are incentivized by voting for shirts that they would like to see win, printed, and delivered to their door for a cheap price.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: They have individuals vote on which t-shirts they want -- so the ones sold are the ones most demanded by the consumers. <p>There are also staff picks where shirt.woot employees select designs to be printed outside of the derby.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: The winners, whose shirts are sold at a discount, are determined via votes. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: The weekly derby allows artists to submit designs for a 1 week period during which other artists and users will vote on designs.  At the end of the week three designs are called the winners, and receive $1,000 + $2 per shirt sold after the first day.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: This information is not readily available. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: This information is not readily available, as it's parent company Woot was bought by Amazon in 2010 for 110 million. However, it's parent company, Woot, had a $164 million dollars in revenue in 2008. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: The incentive scheme would scale well because you could raise the amount paid to artists to attract better quality artists. The quality/aggregation model would also be ok because the shirts are picked by users and the staff -- so more users would automatically mean a more robust aggregation model. If the service were to scale to 100 times size in terms of orders, fast distribution of the t-shirts to users might be an issue without a large enough staff to handle orders, generate t-shirts, and monitor the supply chain. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Attract artists to submit designs to the curated store or weekly derby through the financial incentives described above. Contributors can either submit their t-shirt designs or vote on the designs they like best. If a designer is in the top 3 in voting, he will get paid $1000 the first day and $2 for every shirt sold the day after. The voters will get to purchase the t-shirts that won as well. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: On select days woot will forgoe the "One day, one deal" mantra for a woot-off where deals are set with a fixed volume, and when all units are gone, another deal is put up within minutes.  The users are shown a progress bar, but no specifics on the amount of units left in stock.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: N/A
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: It garners profit from the t-shirts sold.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Waze is a mobile GPS application that provides turn-by-turn directions and attempts to enhance the accuracy of travel times by using user-submitted road information to display for traffic delays and other real-time incidents. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: www.waze.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Uri Levine, Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not particularly, but according to the About page on Waze's website, the idea for the company came from Ehud Shabtai because he was poor at navigating his way to places, and when given a GPS system, he had ideas about how to improve it. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: GPS and turn-by-turn directions
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It enhances the accuracy of estimating travel times and traffic information, and other road information (such as speed traps, construction, etc.)
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Google Maps<p>Apple Maps<p>TomTom<p>Garmin<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The service can really be used by anyone who is trying to navigate from one place to another, and is not sure how to get there, or what the best route is. I have used Waze in the past and have found it to be great, with the traffic data being accurate and the interfacing being nice and very easy to use.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone can contribute to the services, and usually the users themselves are the contributors
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Waze incentivizes contributors by having a social, game-like feature, where users earn points whenever they contribute road information, and as they accumulate points, their ranking in the Waze community increases. However, there does not seem to be a reward for accumulating points, besides validating your contributions to Waze.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Waze relies on the users to ensure the quality of the service – if road or traffic information is incorrect, Waze hopes that users will correct this within the app. For example, Wazers can add the presence of a speed trap on a road, but if a user finds that this speed trap is no longer there, Waze asks the user to update this information in the app. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: N/A
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Waze's point system serves as the reputation system for the app. The more you contribute, the more points you get, and higher your rank within the Waze community. The point system is quite robust, and the method by which points are assigned can be found here https://wiki.waze.com/wiki/Your_Rank_and_Points#The_Table_of_Points<p>
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Waze has very complicated algorithms to aggregate the contributions, part of which depends on the points that the contributor has.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: According to Yahoo, there were nearly 50 million Waze users as of June 2013.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Waze was bought by Google for $1.1 billion but hardly generates revenues. They're revenue is not publicized, but it is known that it is less than $71 million. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I believe that for Waze, the more users the better. More users means more contributors, and more contributors means more accurate information on Waze in terms of traffic and road information. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The contributors contribute by simply driving on the road with the Waze app open. If they run into traffic or notice anything noteworthy on the road (construction, police, an accident, etc.) they can update the map with this information in a hands-free method. This gives the users a real-time map of their surroundings, which ideally has the most accurate traffic and road information available. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: N/A
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: No
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Waze has a location based advertising system that they launched in October 2012, which provided a source of revenue. There are also sources that say that they sell traffic data to companies such as Apple, which is trying to improve its Maps application.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: 99designs crowdsources graphic design.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://99designs.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Matt Mickiewicz, Mark Harbottle
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Matt Mickiewicz started SitePoint Solutions, a content and community website for designers and developers, at age 14. After the site's users started having informal design contests, Mickiewicz decided to create 99designs to separate a marketplace for crowdsourced graphic design.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Crowdsourced graphic design, primarily cheap logo and branding designs for small businesses, start-ups, and non-profits.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces the informal design contests hosted on Mickiewicz's first company.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Many small businesses, startups, and non-profit organizations use this service. An organization answers questions in an online brief, chooses a type of design package, and launches a contest. Designers then submit their designs, to which the company can give feedback. After a week, the company picks the winner, signs the copyright agreement, and the winning designer is paid.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The contributors are graphic designers who submit work to design competitions.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Winning the design competition means that the designer has won the competition holder's business (and is thus compensated for their work). 99designs plays on graphic designers' need for portfolio work, along with the prize of a significant amount of money, in order to motivate participants. Many of the graphic designers are entry-level designers.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company receives a large number of potential designers from its huge graphic designer contributor base. From the submitted designs, the company hosting the contest has the ability to provide feedback to ensure they're getting the design more geared towards their vision.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: The more competitions a designer wins, the more opportunities they'll be selected for.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Designers find contests, to which they submit their design to. The contest host can sift through these designs.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 331,153 contests (not necessarily same as number of users)
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $149 - $2,500
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think its business model would still work well, assuming that the ratio of users to contributors remains the same / is higher. It could be possible the company would need to up its pricing packages, though I'm not sure. There are a huge number of businesses, start-ups, and non-profit organizations, and a great number of graphic designers trying to break into the business -- both who would be comfortable with using 99designs' services for the current pricing plans.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: 99designs markets easy "design you'll love", allowing users to pick a type of design plan, the quality of the plan (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), with the assurance that the company will get a great design after a week. The plan quality relates to the number of designs a user receives and is allowed to provide feedback on. Graphic designers search for jobs best suited to their talents and post designs to the contest. Users get their chosen design at the end of the week, for the rate they initially agreed on.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Yes -- 99designs has been criticized by graphic designers, who argue that it devalues the work of a designer. However, it's said this criticism comes from "middle-level designers" -- those who haven't just started out, but haven't broken into the top range of designers yet. Presumably, beginning-level graphic designers find 99designs great for breaking into the businesses, and top-level designers are not threatened by the business (as they've already secured their desired clientele/career).
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Users are charged a fee for posting a contest on their site.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Threadless sells t-shirts featuring the best designs submitted by artists and voted on by an active community.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.threadless.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2000
  who_were_the_founders: Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: It was founded with only $1000 and was originally a simple community of artists.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Threadless provides both an online community and e-commerce platform.<p>The online community allows artists to submit t-shirt designs and for other artists and fans to rate those designs (and indicate whether they would purchase them).<p>The e-commerce platform then takes the highest rated t-shirts every week, pays the artists for the designs, and then sells t-shirts with those designs.<p>
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It is like a traditional online t-shirt retailer but crowsources the designs and maintains a highly active and invovled community.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Design By Humans (www.designbyhumans.com) is the only other one with significant traction.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Digital artists and graphic designers, people interested in being part of a community, and people who want to buy creative t-shirts.<p>I once submitted a design a couple years ago but it fared poorly. I also voted for a t-shirt that succeeded and ended up buying it (I'll try and wear it to class one of these days).
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Artists submit designs; 200,000 have done so to date,<p>Community members rate the designs and help the Threadless staff decide which ones to print; there are about 2.4 million of them.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Artists make money when their designs are printed.<p>Community members are rewarded by the feeling that they are empowered to choose which designs get printed. Threadless also hires community managers to organize real-life meet-ups and keep members engaged.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company's internal staff reviews the highest rated designs to make sure they are appropriate and of sufficient quality.

  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards:

  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: There votes are averaged to provide an aggregated score for each design.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 2.4 million users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $30 million
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: At 24 or 240 million users, the community would be significantly tougher to manage. Fake voting is already a problem but would become a much tougher problem to deal with after that scale. To ensure quality, raters could perhaps have "karma" points (based off of Reddit) or something similar that would assign a higher weight to their ratings given good behavior in the past.<p>Given that level of poularity, the company would have to also give its artists more money for each design to better motivate them,
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Threadless advertises through banner ads all over the internet and SEM (I've seen a lot of advertisements personally in the last few years).<p>Contributors are either artists who then submit designs to the site. Communtiy members browse the designs and then rate and comment on them, indicating whether the shirt is something they would buy. Every week, the Threadless staff choose the 10 best designs and release them for sale, at which point anyone on the internet can purchase the t-shirts.<p>
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: There was a small controversy about brick and mortat retailer Hot Topic ripping off Threadless t-shirt designs but there was no uproar that was significant enough to incite large attention from the community or legal action from Threadless.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Used the company's service.<p>Haven't conducted an interview, but will interview a "Postmate" this week.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Postmates enables users to order from any restaurant or store by crowdsourcing people to make deliveries within an hour.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://postmates.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2011
  who_were_the_founders: Sam Street, Sean Plaice, and Bastian Lehmann
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not one that we can seem to find. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company provides an on-demand delivery service with a guaranteed delivery time under one hour, in which the user's "postmate" can pick up a list of items from any restaurant or store for a delivery fee under $10 (depending on location). It's essentially like having a personal assistant for an hour who can go to any store and pick up items for you. As the Postmates website states&#58; "If it's an item in a store or restaurant in your city, we can deliver it. Get pizza from Little Star, donuts from Bob's Donuts, a new coat from Nordstrom, a picture frame from Crate & Barrel, you name it."
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: In a sense, Postmates updates Uber's delivery and pick-up service--Uber allows users to deliver an item to another location, or pick-up an item, but the Uber driver is not authorized to make a purchase on behalf of the user. Postmates are authorized to pay for your order, and you are charged upon delivery.<p>Additionally, Postmates is similar to Instacart. Instacart allows users to order groceries, and delivers them within one day (depending on the time of day in which the order was placed). On the other hand, Postmates has a shorter delivery time and has a larger selection of items.<p>Seamless and GrubHub allow users to order food from select restaurants, but Postmates allows users to order food from anywhere.<p>Moreover, whereas it may take a few days to order a clothing item online, users can order Postmates to go to an outlet that might sell that item and pick it up at the store so that the user can have it within an hour. 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Uber<p>Instacart<p>Seamless<p>GrubHub<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Many people order food online through services such as Seamless or GrubHub, but it's frustrating when the restaurant from which you want to order is not on either website, or doesn't offer delivery at all. With Postmates, a user can order from any restaurant, and the Postmate will pick up the order and deliver it. Thus, Postmates attracts those who order in food, as well as people who may be busy and could use someone to run an errand or two for them, such as picking up their dry cleaning, or getting a last minute birthday present for a friend.<p>I've used this service many times before, either to pick up groceries or to order food from restaurants that don't deliver (Chipotle or Sweet Green for example), and it's been a pleasant experience every time. The app allows the user to track exactly where the Postmate is, which is great, since we've all had the experience of ordering food, and then calling the restaurant extremely frustrated at the fact that the food hasn't come in over an hour and the delivery guy has already left the restaurant. With Postmates, you know exactly where your delivery is, and if it is delivered in over an hour, Postmates will refund your purchase. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The couriers, or "Postmates" as they're referred to, come from all over. Some are parents or college students trying to make some extra money on the side, while others are people with delivery backgrounds such as GrubHub or Seamless delivery guys or FedEx drivers, Uber drivers, Lyft drivers, etc. According to the company website, "To be a Postmate you must take pride in delivering exceptional customer service. There are a few other basic requirements - you must be over 18; own a bike, car, truck, scooter or motorcycle; and have an upbeat and positive attitude." Postmates must also complete a background check, attend a 30-minute orientation, and attend an onboarding session before being accepted. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The Postmates website states that experienced Postmates make up to $20/hour on weekdays and $25/hour on weekends, and contributors are allowed to choose their own hours, making for an attractive job to make a little extra cash. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company runs a thorough background check on each of its Postmates, as well as making each Postmate attend an orientation, run a few test jobs, and have an in-person interview. Moreover, the customer service for the app is fantastic, and if the Postmate takes over an hour to make the delivery, Postmates will refund the purchase. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Only in the case of alcohol and cigarette deliveries. In these cases, the standards vary by state. For example, at the moment Postmates can deliver alcohol and cigarettes in New York, as long as the Postmate checks ID upon delivery, whereas in Philadelphia (where Postmates just recently launched within the past two months) Postmates cannot yet deliver alcohol or cigarettes. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: After each delivery, you can rate the Postmate as well as write a review about that Postmate. When placing an order, you see your Postmate's name, photo, and rating. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: N/A
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: As of April, 2014, Postmates were making an average of 10,000 deliveries per week. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Postmates hasn't disclosed their revenue. 
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If the company were to scale to 100 times its current size, it would need to depend on a much larger workforce of "postmates". For this reason, the customer review aggregation would become more important (all couriers we have encountered so far have had a 5 star rating). Additionally, Postmates currently has a culture in which the CEO himself meets with the Postmates, and social events are thrown each week. It may prove to be difficult to maintain this culture when the company scales, and so it may be beneficial for an academia system be set up in the various cities that is responsible for instilling the company's culture and requirement for "good attitude". By maintaining this culture, and ensuring that all Postmates interact, the company may be able to scale while still ensuring a high service quality.<p>Furthermore, the company currently generates revenue by taking a percentage of the delivery fee, as well as payments made by restaurants to be featured on the home screen. If the company scales, then restaurants would be willing to pay a much larger fee to be featured on the home screen. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: At the moment, the majority of Postmates' expansion has been due to word-of-mouth rather than formal advertising campaigns. The contributors contribute by being available during their own set hours to make deliveries for the users, either by bike, car, or truck. This app allows users to pay a small fee to have practically any item that they could buy in a store delivered quickly to their home, making their lives easier and saving time. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: So far, the only controversy that seems to have occurred is that the CEO, in response to an email from customer complaining about past deliveries, thought he was sending an email back to customer service saying "Someone also please tell her to fuck off" but accidentally sent it to the customer, who, in modern fashion, tweeted a screenshot of the email. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company hasn't disclosed its total revenue, but it generates revenue by taking a certain percentage of each delivery fee. It also has a smaller revenue stream coming from the "preferred" restaurants/stores that it features on the apps home screen.

  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/ushahidi/<p>http://www.ushahidi.com/<p>https://wiki.ushahidi.com<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi<p>http://www.no-straight-lines.com/blog/ushahidi-a-story-of-non-linear-innovation/<p>http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/2011/03/09/the-volunteers-behind-the-libya-crisis-map-a-true-story/<p>http://www.missionmode.com/blog/15-disaster-and-crisis-apps-for-iphone-and-ipad/<p>
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Downloaded the Android app, checked out some of the maps.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Ushahidi creates crowd-sourcing applications for social activism, which are most useful for crisis response and political monitoring in the third world.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.ushahidi.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: Ory Okolloh, Erik Hersman, David Kobia, Juliana Rotich
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Yes, it was founded during the aftermath of the 2007-2008 Kenyan election crisis. Meaning "testimony" in Swahili, Ushahidi was originally built so that the people of Kenya could report the political violence occurring through the country. It later expanded to serve a wide range of communities and problems through similar techniques.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company aggregates information concerning political crises and natural disasters to inform the public and make reporting more accurate for the betterment of society.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Google Crisis Response provides similar services to people, with a seemingly larger focus on services which directly help individuals (making emergency plans and preparations, sending updates) rather than aggregating data for general use, although they do this also.<p>There are other apps which provide similar services, but these are often more specific apps for specific problems, and are better at disseminating information provided by experts rather than aggregating information from the general populace. (Also, Ushahidi receives their revenue from licensing their software, and these apps are no threat in this area).
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: This is very difficult, as Ushahidi provides a variety of services and provides information to the public, rather than provide a service per se. A typical example of how somebody might use it would be when a crisis occurs. Especially during the beginning of the crisis, it is difficult for the government, local authorities, or other organizations to gather information and direct the public. Ushahidi allows the people to report information from the scene more easily, so that a person can simply look at the maps and better make decisions about how to react / where to go during the emergency.<p>Ushahidi's improved maps in Haiti were mentioned in class as an example. Additionally, they have done similar things after snow emergencies in Europe, flooding in the Missouri River Basin, and during the political unrest in Libya. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The people are the common citizens in an area in crisis. Quite typically, they are being affected by the crisis, and would like assistance. They likely represent a large part of the population, as anybody can report to Ushahidi as long as they own a cell phone (one can report events via text message, internet is not needed). 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The contributors are often directly affected by the crisis, and would like to let others know what is happening. They are motivated by 1) the assistance they may receive by reporting their troubles and/or 2) the knowledge that they are helping their community/country.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Ideally, the contributors are hoping to receive help, and would want to the advice they report to be accurate, and there is no direct incentive to give false information, especially in non-political crises.<p>Still, those who administrate the maps or other services do have the power to moderate content.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Ushahidi aggregates contributions automatically without filtering by default, although those who organize a crowd-sourced map can moderate data. The ultimate goal of this crowd sourcing is to gather the information for human use, so their aggregation simply consists of collecting.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: The information gathered by Ushahidi can improve the lives of millions.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: This is difficult to say as it is hard to give a price to information goods.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: If this scaling indicates the number of employee, the company could not grow by such a factor given it's relatively limited revenue. Already, much of the work and a sizable portion of the revenue come from voluntary contributors.<p>If this means the size of contributions, then it could scale quite easily, as the data is easily aggregated with little filtering.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Presumably, the service spreads through word of mouth within the community and is encouraged by charitable/humane organizations. Users contribute via interactive maps (or via sms, email in the case of products other than Crowdmap). Their contribution can sometimes result in assistance being delivered to these people, and the available knowledge can often improve organized responses to the problem and shed light on the issue at hand.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: This organization was a little difficult to profile as a non-profit. As such, revenue is not the main concern and we cannot analyze this company in the same way, especially when it comes to market analysis, incentives to users, competitors, etc. It was a very interesting company to profile because of this fact. 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Our research has failed to discover any.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Non-profit organization
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: In addition to donations, the organization generates revenue by deploying its quality software for clients. Ushahidi emphasizes that it does not accept money from governments to maintain neutrality in political crises.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: On October 19th, 2012, Iceland held the world's first ever “crowdsourced constitutional convention” online via Facebook and Twitter. 
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://stjornarskrarfelagid.is/?page_id=2619
  when_was_the_company_started: 2011
  who_were_the_founders: 2011 Iceland Constitutional Council (25 members)
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story:      In 2008, a banking crisis resulted in the near-collapse of the Icelandic economy. The banks were heavily in debt due to the global recession and corruption among the political and banking elite. In addition, citizens were unhappy that many of the country's rich fishing and geothermal national resources were being increasingly owned by foreign interests. In 2009, the center-right government collapsed and was replaced by a government that appointed a council of 25 ordinary citizens to recommend constitutional reform to the Althing, the parliamentary body of Iceland. <p>	94% of the population of Iceland (estimated at 324,000) have access to internet, making it one of the most “online” countries in the world. The constitutional council decided to solicit suggestions for constitutional reform on Facebook and Twitter via a six-question survey. After using the answers to this survey to develop an initial draft, the council gradually iterated over twelve drafts of the new legislation and consistently communicated with ordinary citizens via Facebook and Twitter. Updates of each draft were posted on a public website. Naturally, the opportunity to influence legislation made the survey incredibly popular. By the end of the voting period, over half of Iceland's voting-eligible body had contributed in some way to the process. <p>
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The Constitutional Council was an assembly of 25 people responsible for writing Iceland's new Constitution. At the beginning of their process of writing, they held a national vote on six yes/no questions for the citizens to vote on. During their process of writing, they made all of their drafts available to the public and posted videos of their meetings. They actively encouraged comments and feedback and incorporated that into their future drafts.<p>In short, they provided the service of giving citizens a voice in the writing of their Constitution.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces the traditional way that Constitutions were written&#58; by a small group of intellectuals in an intentionally secretive and obscured manner.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Some regions of the United States have tried crowdsourcing policies. Seattle's budget director, Beth Goldberg, created an online game that used people to make decisions about the budget in an attempt to shave off unnecessary money to close a $30 million gap in funding. However, this was only an experiment to see if the administration's cuts would align with the public's cuts. No crowdsourced government document has been executed on the same scale as Iceland's.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The Constitutional Council posts a draft of the Constitution on Facebook and the public website, and a user can comment on it with feedback and suggestions.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone with an internet connection could comment on the constitution Facebook or Twitter. Because the constitution is written in Icelandic, it is a foregone conclusion that only Icelandic nationals or expats would contribute.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Obviously, the ability for an ordinary citizen to potentially influence legislation, especially after an economic crisis, was a powerful incentive to participate.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The Constitution wasn't /truly/ crowdsourced in the sense that the text that went into the Constitution did not for the most part come from “the crowd.” Instead, commenters' feedback was incorporated into the Constitutional Council's decisions as to what to include, exclude or change in their draft of the Constitution.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Obviously, the ability to influence legislature is normally heavily “regulated”. A parliament member's ideas for change are regulated by his/her voting rights and the voting of all other members of the parliamentary body. In this case, the Althing, Iceland's parliamentary body, was dissolved before it could pass or reject the final draft because of political reasons. Elections were coming up and the ruling party was wary about experimenting with government legislature on a national scale. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: For the initial poll of six yes/no questions, the results were simply aggregated by summing up the number of votes on each one. For the comments on the successive drafts of the constitution, members of the Constitutional Council would comb through all of the online comments and take them into consideration, and they would even regularly meet with the commenters.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 120,000 people
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Iceland 2012 GDP&#58; $13.66 Billion
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: In general, I would guess that likelihood of success of a crowdsourced Constitution is inversely correlated with size of the country. For one, with more people, each person feels that his/her voice accounts for a smaller portion of the overall voice going into the Constitution. This leads to increased bystander effect and a lower participation rate (which was low in Iceland's case to begin with). This would lower the legitimacy of the Constitution's claim to truly represent all citizens' interests. Additionally, even though a lower percentage of people would participate, there would still be a higher volume of comments and feedback for the Constitution writers to comb through. This could lead to commenters trying to make more sensationalist comments for the sake of gaining Likes, Retweets, and Upvotes, just so they can get noticed, rather than truly substantive suggestions that writers can pick out for their own merits. Plus, most other countries do not have as high of prevalence of the Internet as Iceland does, so many citizens would be forcibly excluded due to their technical incapability. It is also unclear how this situation would play out in the United States, which has a much more diverse electorate and has a very polarized political system at present.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service was advertised via traditional social media channels (Facebook/Twitter), local and international publications, and the public website that continuously issued new drafts and newsletter updates. Initially, citizens answered a six-question yes/no survey that served as the base of constitutional reform (one of the questions was&#58; “do you believe Iceland needs constitutional reform?”). Afterwards, the members of the council asked for direct written feedback on Facebook/Twitter, which they interacted with and incorporated into the drafts. In the end, citizens got an assurance that their suggestions were being taken into consideration.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: This experiment unfortunately didn't get passed by the government, but its high engagement and large comment base suggest that this crowd-governance model may be something that we see popping up in isolated situations in bigger countries and perhaps affecting larger legislation in smaller countries with high Internet access like Iceland. Japan and/or South Korea would be good frontiers to try this next.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: As referenced earlier, Iceland was a country that had just come out of a deep economic crisis in 2008. By 2012, the national economy was just starting to recover, so the logic behind running an experimental crowdsourcing platform for a new constitution was questionable. One of the most controversial aspects of the new suggested constitution was a provision in which all non-privately held natural resources, mainly fish and geothermal energy, would immediately fall under national property. Such radical nationalization methods may discourage future foreign investment in Iceland, adversely hurting their economy. Furthermore, this ruling would significantly hurt the business holdings of native Icelanders who owned large swaths of fishing coasts (known as “Sea barons”). Other minor issues revolve around declaring a national church and not giving equal weightage to votes regardless of location.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Government body
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Because we're discussing the use of crowdsourcing in a governmental context, this question seems non-applicable.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Coursera is a free online education platform that partners with universities to offer online classes to users.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.coursera.org/
  when_was_the_company_started: April 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Coursera was started by two Stanford University computer science professors who wanted to make quality higher education more accessible to the public. Andrew Ng taught a free machine learning course online and found over a 104,000 users from all over the world enrolled for the course. After only a month into teaching the machine learning course, Ng and colleague Daphne Koller left their tenured faculty jobs to start Coursera full time in April 2012 after raising $16 million from a round of venture funding.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Coursera provides massive open online courses (MOOCs), typically at the university level. These courses are designed and taught by professors at universities that Coursera has partnered with. The format of these courses are short videos, quizzes, and problem sets. In some courses, the pace is set by the user while other courses are regulated by the professor. There is also Q&A section for each course. Verification certificates are offered for some courses for pay. There are also specializations offered; these are essentially a series of courses on a related topic. Specialization certificates are awarded if verification certificates are earned in each of the courses.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Coursera is an improvement in the online education space and is unique in multiple regards compared to previous competitors. It was one of the first (although multiple similar companies, including edX and the Minerva Project, started at the same time) to offer quizzes and problem sets alongside educational videos. Khan Academy, which started in 2006, offers mostly educational videos, without the extra testing. Udacity, which began in January 2012, offers mainly courses in computer science. Coursera has a range of selections, including STEM as well as humanities courses.

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Users of Coursera consist primarily of people who want to learn for their own interests and/or learn new skills that could make them more attractive to employers. Furthermore, Coursera's users wish to learn for free, or learn at only a small cost. Users sign up for an account and then sign up for courses based on their interest areas. Users can then proceed through the videos, quizzes, problem sets, and peer-reviewed assessments of problem sets either at their own pace or, for some courses, at the pace set by the instructor. Courses that are self-paced can be started at any time, but courses that are not can only be joined when sessions are scheduled. All the courses can be taken for free, and once the course is completed, a certification of completion is awarded. Some courses offer “verified certificates” upon completion, but this requires payment from the user. The “verified certificates” are certifications by Coursera and the university providing the course that the user has successfully completed the course; it requires verification of user identity to ensure the user and not someone else is doing the work. Successfully obtaining verified certificates in all of the courses in a specialization series allows the user to get a “specialization certificate.” Specialization series are a group of courses that allow the user to gain skills in a specific area, such as data science or modern music.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The people who contribute services are primarily professors at universities. Coursera has partnered with 100 global universities and 7 non-university partners so far.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: The contributors of Coursera (aka the professors) are primarily motivated to participate by their own interest to contribute to the education platform. Many of the universities have their own education initiatives, like Penn's Open Learning program.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company partners with universities to provide courses so there is some inherent guarantee of quality of the content because of the high level at which the professors who teach the courses are employed. The full process is as follows. University staff work together to ensure the quality of the course description page before it is submitted to Coursera. Coursera then verifies the course description page and uploads it to their website. The instructor must provide a detailed description of the content and resources to be used at least two months in advance through a Course Development Agreement (CDA). The instructor, university staff, and Coursera all sign the CDA, holding them responsible for the class. A minimum amount of content needs to be uploaded a month before the class. Instructor and university staff are responsible for continued content monitoring during the course, and Coursera continues monitoring student discussions and technical issues. If Coursera notices any course issues on the student discussions, it relays it to the instructor. Coursera also develops a system of feedback for the students to offer comments on the course to instructors.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Education at the university level is regulated by the government to some extent. Both public and private universities have to comply with certain government regulations, although private universities typically have much more freedom. The intent of government regulation is to provide a higher quality of education and to improve access to education. With regards to education quality, it's difficult to say whether Coursera meets the government's standards because its goal and approach differs from those at traditional universities. However, being that most courses are taught by professors at well-respected universities, Coursera's courses are of high quality. With regard to accessibility, Coursera does meet government standards.
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: We did not find a reputation system on the Coursera website itself. However, we found a third party website called CourseTalk that allows users to view reviews for Coursera courses and review the courses themselves.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Each course is individually prepared by staff at a university (or one of the non-university partners), and the courses are aggregated through the Coursera website.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Coursera had 7 million registered users as of April 2014, and it had 22,232,448 enrollments as of January 2014.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Coursera had generated $1 million in revenue as of October 2013 (the most recent estimate we found).
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: We think that if Coursera were to scale up in size, it would still be able to successfully provide its services because it is primarily an internet-based service. However, we also believe that Coursera's current business model is not very profitable and that it will need to modify its business model if it wants to make more profit.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised as a free online educational platform that offers courses in a variety of subjects. The target audience is people who want to learn anything new; many are workers who want to freshen their skills as well as students who want to earn credit or learn something new for no credit. Contributors design courses and teach them through videos, as described in the question about how quality is regulated. The users are able to sign up for courses based on course descriptions for free or for a price if they want a verification certificate from Coursera and the university. After completion, a certificate or statement of completion is given for most courses. A more detailed explanation of verification certificates is in the question about how users use the service.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: Despite having generated relatively little revenue so far, Coursera continues to generate a large amount of venture funding. Their most recent round in November 2013 raised $20 million and the total venture capital so far totals $85 million. Their current business model seems to focus more on the mission statement of providing high-level education to the general public, but it does not seem ideal for generating a lot of revenue. They did not have any substantial revenue before adding the option for paying for certificates in January 2013.<p>There has also been some talk about providing MOOC users with the a job-finding service and charging commission. Coursera hasn't added a corporate section yet but may do so in the future.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: In January 2014, Coursera was notified by the U.S. government that providing the course experience is considered a service and that all services are restricted by export controls. As a result, Coursera temporarily suspended service in Iran, Sudan and Cuba. Coursera announced in September 2014 that it was able to reopen course access to residents of Sudan and Cuba, but access to Coursera courses by Iran residents remains limited.<p>More generally, there has been a fair amount of controversy about the effectiveness of MOOCs compared to traditional courses. Concerns have been raised about the fact that MOOCs teach through online videos without direct teacher or classmate interaction. There are doubts in the effectiveness of learning in the courses without the incentive of receiving credit for them. The issue of reliability is also a huge obstacle in providing university credit for MOOCs.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Coursera generates revenue by&#58;<p>Charging for its Verified Certificates.<p>Receiving revenue from an Amazon.com affiliates program when users of the website purchase books suggested by professors.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: No
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Foldit is a collabortation between the University of Washington's Center for Game Science and Dept. of Biochemistry, utilizing crowdsourcing in the form of a game in order to solve a real world problem involving protein geometry
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://fold.it/portal/
  when_was_the_company_started: 2008
  who_were_the_founders: David Baker and Seth Cooper
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founders were working with another automated solution to predict the natural structures of various proteins. This solution used protein structure prediction algorithms, which take lots of time and processing power to run. This program was later expanded to utilize the processing power of people's PCs around the world to run some of the algorithms. Users began to notice that they could see potential solutions to the structures, but since they couldn't interact with the algorithms they couldn't add their own insights into the program. Thus, FoldIt was born. The founders and their team turned the program into an interactive game that merges distributed computing and algorithmic predictions with the ability for people to tinker with the protein structures themselves.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It provides people with the opportunity to play an entertaining game while helping scientists solve challenging problems in biochemistry, such as how to target and eradicate diseases in the body.  
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It replaces a purely algorithmic approach that was used to predict the native structures of various proteins, called Rosetta. This was then extended to utilize the processing power of user's personal computers, by developing a distributed computing program - Rosetta@home. However, users became frustrated that they could not interact with the program itself, eventually leading to an interactive version known as Foldit.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: There are a number of other human-based computation games including&#58;<p>ESP Game (labeling of images)<p>EteRNA (RNA folding)<p>Phylo (decoding code for genetic diseases)<p>
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: An individual can sign up to donate a portion of his or her own computing power to assist with the project. In addition, they may participate actively in the game, which lets them play with the different configurations of proteins until they or the program think that they have found a potential solution. This solution is then analyzed by the program to predict how viable the structure is. If it is deemed a realistic possibility, the solution is sent to the experts at the University of Washington for further analysis. Since there are so many possible configurations for each protein, the possibilities are seemingly endless. The contributions from users help accelerate the prediction process.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: Roughly equal numbers
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone, probably mostly online gamers
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: They have created a game like interface for the program, which in turn provides users with intrinsic motivation to configure better guesses.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The best guesses from users are first analyzed by the algorithms that the FoldIt team has been working on since the program's inception. The ones that stand out in that pool are presented to the experts themselves, who continuously monitor the quality of the results that the algorithms churn out.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Players are rated based on frequency of success in guessing viable protein shapes.  Highest scoring configurations are then sent to experts for further analysis.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: All solutions are collected by a central system and rated by viability - the highest scoring entries are then sent to experts for further analysis.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 240,000 users as of 2012
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: It would still work relatively well because a lot of the analysis of how well players do is done algorithmically. However, if there were that many more people playing and contributing viable solutions, the scientists would probably have to expand their human team to keep up.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is advertised as is; the website encourages contributors to "solve puzzles for science," and explains to them what the goal of the project is and why it matters. The users then play the game, and they get intrinsic gratification when the do well. When they do well, the project's scientists accrue data that will help them solve the puzzles involved in predicting the natural shapes of proteins.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: The project is regularly featured in documentaries about how crowd-souring and human computation are changing the future of science.
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: None that we know of.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Research Project
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: It does not generate revenue, as it is a university sponsored research project.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I used the Flixster app, which acquired Rotten Tomatoes
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Rotten Tomatoes aggregates film reviews from critics and average viewers
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: August 12, 1998
  who_were_the_founders: Senh Duong, Patrick Lee, Stephen Wang
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Senh Duong, creative director at Design Reactor, developed the website as a side project, starting with aggregating reviews of all Jackie Chan movies. From its launch, the site was immediately successful, going viral linked with hit movies such as Star Wars&#58; Episode 1 and The Blair Witch Project. Patrick Lee and Stephen Wang tried to convince Duong to come back to Design Reactor, bringing Rotten Tomatoes with him, but eventually decided to instead join him at Rotten Tomatoes as its own entity, with their company, Design Reactor, as a sister company. 
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Aggregate movie and TV show reviews by users and critics; provides an aggregate rating. 
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model

  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: The user can either expressly go to the Rotten Tomatoes website to look up reviews and ratings or (more commonly), use Flixster to look up showtimes, etc., where the user will also be shown the movies rotten tomatoes score and reviews (from critics and users). As a user, I've only used it in the context of Flixster, but the ratings definitely carry serious weight, and if I see a movie with a low rating (below 60% will show a green "rotten tomato"), I will often check the reviews, and often not see the movie. 
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Users with Rotten Tomatoes or Flixster accounts (users can log into Rotten Tomatoes with with Facebook accounts as well). Users can also register as Critics, although they must be cleared as critics at well-standing publications, or something similar. Users' contributions are marked and sorted as either by regular users or by critics. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: People are likely to contribute to have their opinions heard, especially if they felt very strongly (in one direction or the other) about a film or TV show. If a user's reviews get many likes, they can become critics and their reviews will carry more weight. There are also message boards on which users can discuss movies, TV shows, etc., so there is a social interaction incentive to communicate and contribute as well. 
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Rotten Tomatoes staff read critics' reviews and decide whether they are positive or negative. When a film or TV show has received enough reviews, the staff will also write a brief summary on the consensus for the movie that takes in all the reviews. A movie is "certified fresh" if it has more than 75% positive reviews and at least 40 reviews from Tomatometer critics (5 of which must be top critics). This ensures that they are providing an accurate and well-rounded review of the movie/show. 
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: (no regulation)
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: As above, top critics are cleared by the staff, and their reviews must also have a certain number of likes from other users. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: As above, the Rotten Tomatoes staff rates each review as positive or negative, and the final score is the percentage of positive reviews. On Flixster, the reviews are also sorted between users and critics. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 3,950,000 visitors / day; Alexa Rank&#58; 686
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $ 21,329,640 / year
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: No, because revenue is generated from advertising. Advertising hits viewers as well as contributors, but scaling up contributors does not necessarily increase total views (users + contributors), and further, while ad revenue is more closely linked to total views, it is not linearly correlated.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: A user goes onto the website or Flixster app, picks the movie she wants to review, and writes her review. The Rotten Tomatoes staff will determine if the review is positive or negative, which will affect the movies score. The review will also be listed when other users look at the movie's rating, either under critics or users, depending on who wrote the review. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: As with any site that is in open forum on the Internet, there is the danger of people commenting hurtful, dangerous, or threatening things. This happened to such an extreme around the release of the third Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, that the commenting section was temporarily shut down. This raised questions of monitoring content, as well as holding users more accountable for what they say online. It also touched on issues of conflict of interests as Rotten Tomatoes is a part of Flixster, which is owned by Warner Brothers, which also produced the Batman Trilogy (although Rotten Tomatoes said the decision to temporarily shut off the commenting capabilities was purely internal). 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Part of Flixster, which is owned by Warner Brothers, which is a subsidiary of Time Warner
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company's primary source of revenue, like many web companies, is online advertising

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I interviewed two friends who were using kickstarter to fund their entrepreneurial projects - Rebag to recycle old clothes into bags and Vigo to make headset that will keep you from falling asleep. I've also donated on kickstarter before, though never started my own project.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Kickstarter is a crowdfunding website to support creative projects
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.kickstarter.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: 28 April 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, Charles Adler
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The founder Perry Chen got the idea after he failed to play a show during the 2002 Jazz Festival because of the lack of funding. He found a great venue and reached out to their management, but in the end the show never happened—it was just too much money. He was bothered by the fact that the potential audience had no say in this decision. Then he started thinking - What if people could go to a site and pledge to buy tickets for a show? And if enough money was pledged they would be charged and the show would happen. If not, it wouldn't. That's where he started looking for partners to start Kickstarter
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It provides a platform for people to post their projects and get funding from the crowd. Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Project creators will reward the backers by sharing a piece of their projects to them.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: According to a news article in 2009 when Kickstarter was just started, Kickstarter expanded the crowdfunding model by Sellaband to not just bands but more general creative categories. There has been websites providing similar service at the time like FirstGiving, PledgeBank and Mob Incentive. Kickstarter updated the previous model to specifically promote creative projects, and does not take any ownership like some of the past models do - it only provides the platform for people to post and contribute, and started charging 5% of the money raised for its own profit and development.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Indiegogo<p>FirstGiving<p>PledgeBank<p>Angels Den<p>Mob Incentive.
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: In order to make it creative project specific, Kickstarter has limited the categories of crowdfunding to Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater. For example, if a independent film producer wants to make a theatrical piece but does not have enough funding, he can start a project on Kickstarter to raise money, and if successful, invite those who donate the most to his movie premiere or send copies to them.<p>A friend of mine who's building his start-up Vigo - a headset that will detect your drowsiness and keep you awake - put a photo of his prototype on kickstarter to raise money for larger manufacturing, and promise to reward donors who donate more than a specific amount by giving them a free copy of the headset once they are manufactured.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: In this case, people contributing services are the backers who contribute money to enable project creators to finish their project. It is not particularly a kind of service, but more funding related patronage.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Kickstarter uses a all-or-nothing model, meaning that if a project doesn't meet its funding goal, no money will be charged from the users. This gives users incentive to contribute and mediate bystander effect. If people want to see a project come to life, they're going to spread the word. Moreover, project leaders will reward contributors if the project is successfully funded, usually in a related way (e.g. if an art project is successfully funded, contributors will receive a copy of that art)
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Since the "patronage service" from the contributors only include donating money, in this case the quality of the users - people who post their projects - are more important for the quality of the company. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn't fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. However, Kickstarter does not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. On Kickstarter, backers (you!) ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it.

  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Money pledged by donors is collected using Amazon Payments. No money will be charged before the project reaches its goal, and if it does, Kickstarter will charge the credit cards provided by backers, aggregate all the money, take 5% fee (Amazon will take 3-5% as well) and give the rest to the creator. The platform is open to backers from anywhere in the world and to creators from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 175,240 Project created and 6,961,320 Total backers
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $1,305,226,696 total dollars pledged to Kickstarter projects
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think the model will still work, because Kickstarter does not develop anything themselves or take ownership of any of the projects - they merely provide a platform for creators to post their projects and contributors to donate, so the amount of work for the website itself is minimum - just to maintain the scalability of the site to support more posts, more accounts and more transactions. The incentive scheme wouldn't be affected too much either, because most creators on Kickstarter share the post with their family and friends and get the word out somewhere else through their own channel (interviews, social media, etc). It might only affect the competitiveness of getting featured on Kickstarter, because according to the research done by a Wharton professor, featuring does significantly increase the possibility of success.<p>The quality model might be affected more, Not for those contributors who come because they heard of their friends' projects or read about it on media or press - because they know the legibility of project creators before they go to those kickstarter pages - but for contributors who just go on Kickstarter and browse for new projects to donate, scaling up to 10 or 100 times means there might be more scams out there on the site (just like Criaglist), and it's much harder to verify with their own judgement since Kickstarter doesn't provide any reputation system or guarantee of completion.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: When the users want to raise money for their projects, they can post on Kickstarter with the amount of money they want, the cause of their project, detail budget plan, press articles, what they will make as final product, and how much reward people are getting based on their contribution. They can then share the link to social media, their friends and market about their idea to attract more contributor to donate to their product through Kickstarter. Eventually, if the goal is reached, they will get enough money for their product.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: One thing I was trying to figure out at the beginning of this research is whether the creators or the backers on kickstarter are users. Traditionally, on a crowdsourcing website, contributors are those who post and users are using the service, while on kickstarter, the real users are those creators, because they go to the website demanding funding for their projects. Backers became the contributors and contribute their money. Therefore, most content on the site are created by the users. Here the definitions of user and contributor are a bit blurry, because everyone comes to the platform both with some demand and things they can supply, which I think is the core of crowdsourcing platforms - to create a win-win situation for both users and contributors (however they are defined)
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: There have been several controversies regarding creators misuse their money or copyright issues.<p>In May 2011, a New York University film student, Matias Shimada, raised $1,726 to make a film, but plagiarized another film instead. Later, he publicly apologized.<p>In 2012, Amanda Palmer raised $1.2 million on Kickstarter. She wrote about how she used the money, however several other musicians reviewed these expenses and said they were extravagant and possibly fraudulent.<p>In April 2013, filmmaker Zach Braff used a Kickstarter campaign to fund his upcoming film Wish I Was Here and raised $2 million in three days, citing the success of Rob Thomas' Veronica Mars Kickstarter as his inspiration. Some have criticized Braff for using the site, saying celebrity use of the site will draw attention away from filmmakers and other creatives who don't have celebrity name recognition, a criticism that had been previously made in regards to big figures in the gaming industry using Kickstarter (such as Richard Garriott, who created a successful $1+ million Kickstarter despite his large personal fortune).Kickstarter has disputed these arguments by reporting that, according to their metrics, big name projects tend to attract new visitors to the site who in turn pledge to other lesser known projects.<p>On November 6, 2013, writer/director Hal Hartley launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce his upcoming film Ned Rifle, seeking a total of $384,000. On November 25, Hartley added a $9,000 reward tier offering the film's distribution rights for seven years in the United States and other countries, making his Kickstarter campaign the first to propose offering film distribution rights. Subsequently, Kickstarter notified Hartley that selling distribution rights is a form of investment, which is forbidden by Kickstarter's terms and conditions, forcing Hartley to remove the option.<p>On September 30, 2011, Kickstarter filed a request for declaratory judgment against ArtistShare's U.S. crowd-funding patent US 7885887, "Methods and apparatuses for financing and marketing a creative work". Kickstarter asked that the patent be invalidated, or, at the very least, that the court find that Kickstarter is not liable for infringement. In February 2012, ArtistShare and Fan Funded responded to Kickstarter's complaint by filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. They asserted that patent infringement litigation was never threatened, that "ArtistShare merely approached Kickstarter about licensing their platform, including patent rights", and that "rather than responding to ArtistShare's request for a counter-proposal, Kickstarter filed this lawsuit." The judge has ruled, however, that the case can go forward. ArtistShare has since responded by filing a counterclaim alleging that Kickstarter is indeed infringing its patent.<p>On November 21, 2012, 3D Systems filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Formlabs and Kickstarter for infringing its 3D printer patent US 5,597,520, ”Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.” Formlabs had raised $2.9 million in a Kickstarter campaign to fund its own competitive printer. The company said that Kickstarter caused "irreparable injury and damage" to its business by promoting the Form 1 printer, and taking a 5% cut of pledged funds.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Kickstarter originally didn't charge any transaction fee according to an article from 2009, but now charge 5% of all the money raised for a project before giving the money to the project creators.

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Yelp
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://techcrunch.com/tag/yelp/<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/dining/reviews-on-yelp-help-track-illness.html<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpDR3iii8HM<p>http://www.pcworld.com/article/249770/beyond_yelp_which_user_review_services_matter_.html
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Use the service all the time, received an offer to intern last year but declined (thus also interviewing with three engineers and a recruiter along the way, all of whom wanted to inform me on the product, its direction, etc.)
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Yelp sources local reviewers and amateur critics to review local services, thus giving small businesses a way to advertise and be compared by other consumers.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://yelp.com
  when_was_the_company_started: Oct. 2004
  who_were_the_founders: Jeremy Stoppelman, Russel Simmons, Geoff Donaker
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Stoppelman and Simmons were working on a startup after leaving Paypal when Stoppelman caught the flu.  Not having a good method of finding local doctors to consult, he came up with the idea that there should be a service that let consumers rate the services they used locally, so that others would be able to find and use the same services.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: For consumers&#58; solves the pain points of locating and rating services.  Makes it easy to find what other customers thought of a specific business.<p>For small businesses&#58; can pay for advertising to be shown at the top of a search results list, can pay for Yelp to host a "Yelp elite party" at the business in order to garner more valuable reviews that attract more customers.  Improves visibility.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Angie's List
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: I primarily use Yelp to find local restaurants to visit.  Going to the page of the restaurant shows other users' reviews and the average rating for the restaurant, allowing me to easily scroll through and pick the one that other people think has the best food.  Without Yelp, I would have no way of judging the difference between local restaurants without visiting them myself.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: The Yelp elite are people who have been identified as having a certain amount of clout in the community, or who use Yelp on a daily basis and have many followers.  These elite users are invited to parties by the company where they then contribute reviews to the business's page, expanding the amount of data and ratings that the business has.<p>Normal users also contribute ratings and reviews, but there are many users who don't necessarily review every place they've been to.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: For Yelp elite, the benefits are free parties (including food and drink) at the business they're invited to review, as well as a host of followers and the ability to be an amateur critic.<p>For normal contributors, there's always the chance that one will be picked to become Yelp elite.  The motivation for users to contribute reviews is mostly because they want to voice their honest opinions about a particular business if they had a great experience or a subpar one.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: There is very common criticism of Yelp and the quality of the reviews and users.  The quality checks are crowdsourced as well, with users being able to flag other users and the businesses that own their own pages able to respond or otherwise change the appearance of their reviews page.  However, Yelp has been accused more than once of driving revenue by essentially blacklisting some small businesses that do not pay them for advertising services, lowering them to the bottom of the search list or denying the removal of toxic reviews.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Users can rate other users' reviews to be useful, funny, or cool.  Users can also ask to be friends with other users, so that some prolific reviewers can gather large followings and thus gain reputation.  Yelp elite are designated by the service as such, and their reviews have more value than others due to their reputations.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Reviews are aggregated on the main page of a local business and anyone who visits the page can read them.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 112 million unique/month
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Revenue $233 million as of 2013, but Yelp has never been profitable.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: For Yelp to be 10 or 100 times its size, it would have to be in complete control of the entire market that is local business advertising worldwide.  Its business model is based off of advertising and search ranking, so it will scale just as Google did.  The incentive scheme for local businesses will only increase with the number of users, and the reviews will keep pouring in just as an effect of human nature.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Yelp doesn't do any advertising to look for reviewers, it merely provides a platform where local businesses have pages and reviewers are composed of anyone who has used the service and wishes to post a review.  The reviewers type up good or bad reviews, their experiences, what they ate/saw/did, and a star rating of the business, and the users who then visit the webpage can read that review along with others before deciding whether to use the business's service.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Many.  Almost biannually, there is a news report that Yelp is extorting its customers (small businesses) by lowering their traffic if they refuse to pay.  Since it's such a large business that drives revenue to small businesses, it also has complete control over how they are perceived by users.  In a recent op-ed, chefs are against Yelp because it reduces a business to a single negative review, and the negative outweighs the positive.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Publicly traded company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The local businesses can pay to advertise their pages, which makes them rise to the top of the search rankings and get more visibility to customers.<p>A few years ago, Yelp came out with Yelp deals, which displays discounts on each business that Yelp users can claim, thus driving more traffic to the business and getting a cut of the extra revenue generated.<p>I was told by one of the engineering managers that they're looking to work on a food ordering system and to integrate it with the business pages, much like Seamless/Grubhub/etc.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: Yes, I tried the company's service. I have been a user for a few years.<p>Also, I thought it was interesting how Quora itself was a great resource for me, because many people had already asked these questions about the service and were able to get "expert" responses from Quora employees directly.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Quora is a Q&A aggregator that incentivizes well-written answers through the earning of digital credits and a lack of anonymity.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://www.quora.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: June 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Adam D'Angelo, Charlie Cheever
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Not particularly. The founders were both early employees of Facebook who sought to disrupt the Q&A space, which many would agree was somewhat of a mess excluding certain niche communities such as Stack Overflow.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company allows users to ask and answer questions. Users earn credits from the community by posting interesting questions or well-written and helpful answers. Those credits then allow users to ask "experts" questions.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Quora is an update to the online Q&A business model. The monetization model is not new as it will likely be heavily ad-based. However, Quora updates the way in which high quality questions and answers are incentivized.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Jelly<p>Ask.fm<p>Spring.me<p>Stack Exchange<p>Blurtit
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: You first sign up via email, Google, Facebook, or Twitter. You then select a variety of topics you are interesting in. The homepage is a list of questions that Quora believes you may be interested in. I have primarily used it as a tool to find information via pre-existing questions and answers on very specific topics where I desire insider information from experts. Quora has been very good at suggesting questions I may be interested in.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone, although Quora is notable because it also has well-known contributers such as Michael Dell.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Quora allows access to better answers to your questions from "experts" if you spend "credits". Credits are only acquired by first providing high quality answers yourself.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Quora ensures quality content through the incentive scheme described previously.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: Users can up-vote questions and answers. Users can also pay credits to "experts" to receive a presumably high quality answer to a question.
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Questions are grouped into topics.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: Estimated between 3 and 5 registered users. However, Quora notoriously does not share its growth numbers.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $0 revenue. $900 million valuation.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: I think the incentive scheme would scale very well, especially since it has already managed to establish a large community of high quality users with many credits. Since experts and users with an established track record are given higher priority, the system does not succumb to the problems of a pure democracy (e.g. Yahoo Answers).
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service does not appear to advertise via ads. In my experience, much of it's advertising has been via digital word-of-mouth and email sharing. All users are both question- and answer-contributers. Users are incentivized to provide high quality answers in order to receive high quality answers of their own.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Similar to LinkedIn, Quora has been criticized for pulling information for social networks (such as friend lists) to make it appear as though friends are registered users.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: The company generates zero revenue and is still in the funding stages. However, the Founder D'Angelo has stated that the site will likely introduce ads in 2015.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I emailed the founder and another employee, but they're yet to get back to me
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Comuni-Chiamo is a crowdsource problem management tool for municipalities
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://comuni-chiamo.com
  when_was_the_company_started: 2012
  who_were_the_founders: Gilberto Cavallina
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: The company was started because historically, municipalities in Italy have had a hard time dealing with problems such as fixing roads and picking up garbage. More than merely signalling the problems to the local government (of which they're often already aware), it gives the local representatives incentive to fix the problems and recorded accountability if they don't, as italian politicians often sweep issues like this under the rug
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: It is essentially a waze for signalling problems in common areas within municipalities, such as roads, traffic lights, destruction in public parks, etc. The service aggregates all these citizen's signals and makes the list available to both the community and local government officials.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: The most similar app I can think of is Waze because through citizen's altruism of going through the hassle of signalling traffic (or problems in Comuni-Chiamo's case), they help others avoid traffic (or fix the problems in our case)
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: I've never used it because it is still not available in my municipality in Italy. But this service is intended for any citizen with a smart phone! It works particularly well in Italy because there are a lot of evident problems that go unfixed for years...
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More contributors than users
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Normal citizens who are tired of having small and easily fixable problems in their municipality 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: the fact that the problem will eventually be resolved. But even more than that, the fact that they can hold government officials accountable for not taking care of the problems. With this app people in the government can no longer claim they didn't know about the problem. Also, normally signalling problems to local gov't is a huge hassle because you have to go to a police station and file a lot of paperwork, which obviously not many are willing to do!
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: No
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: they ask for evidence of the problem one sees and they don't allow duplicate entires about the same problem
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: it doesn't break any regulations because it is simply signalling. They are just taking the hassle and paper work out of filing a formal problem report with the local gov't
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: No
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: they don't allow duplicate reports for the same problem, but people can comment on hot and more pertinent topics to ensure they will be looked at more promptly
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: ~300,000-500,000
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: N/A
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: it would work perfectly well because the incentives are extremely tangible even on a larger scale. People will have problems with the state of their municipality on a micro-level. The only problem I see is that if this is done in a place like NYC, then there's simply going to be too many reports for the gov't to possibly fix, but then again, the more people agree with one specific problem, the more attention it will get from the gov't
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: it's not really advertised in the mainstream, but only in the municipalities it currently operates in (~30). People contribute by signalling the problem and providing evidence of it on the platform. The user in the end will *hopefully* get this problem resolved by the municipality. The more people comment or make a specific problem 'hot', the more likely gov't officials will divert their attention to fixing it.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: Let's go Italy!!
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: The only main controversy has come from gov't officials who claim they already do this job perfectly well and they shouldn't have to deal with yet another source of hassle. Honestly, they're just being lazy and don't actually want to deal with the problems
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Through geo-targeted advertising

  what_company_are_you_profiling: Uber
  what_online_resources_did_you_use_in_researching_it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)<p>http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/11/hailing-a-cab-with-your-phone/66630/<p>http://www.cnet.com/news/car-service-uber-raises-32-million-launches-in-paris/<p>http://www.forbes.com/sites/aswathdamodaran/2014/06/10/a-disruptive-cab-ride-to-riches-the-uber-payoff/<p>http://www.inc.com/magazine/201307/christine-lagorio/companies-that-are-like-uber.html
  did_you_use_any_other_resources: I've ridden Uber multiple times as well as downloaded both their iPhone and Android applications.
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Uber provides the personal chauffeur driven car experience to anyone and a marginally greater price.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.uber.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: March 2009
  who_were_the_founders: Garrett Camp, Travis Kalanick
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Uber began in 2009 in San Francisco as "UberCab" with the mobile applications being launched for both Android and iPhone in 2010. By late 2011 the company had raised almost $49.5 million dollars in venture capital funding from Angel Investors in the Silicon Valley area as well as institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs, Menlo Ventures etc.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company provides Ridesharing services. It works like a call a cab taxi service but provides chauffeur driven luxury vehicles at a marginally higher cost. The app provides billing and guidance and payment is made electronically via a credit / debit card.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Completely new
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: 
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Hailo<p>Lyft<p>Sidecar<p>BlackJet<p>Swifto
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: If you're looking for a taxi or a ride, you open the UBER app and specify your pickup location. You also specify the kind of vehicle you would like. Once an appropriate vehicle has been found the driver is contacted and messaged your details and he goes to pick you up from your specified location. After the driver drops you off you end the trip and exit the vehicle. Your credit card is automatically charged the fare for the trip.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone who owns a vehicle as specified by Uber's requirements and falls in one of the categories of cars they offer to customers can sign up to be a driver for Uber. They must meet certain standards and specifications but once they're approved they use the Uber app on their device to provide service to customers. 
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Uber drivers are paid for every ride they undertake. The payment depends on the duration and distance covered. By pooling in available drivers Uber gives them higher custom than they'd be able to source on their own in the luxury travel sector.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Uber ensures that the drivers contributing to the Uber network pass stringent quality and standard checks before they're officially commissioned to become a part of the Uber network.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Technically, Uber doesn't fall under a Taxi service and is thus exempt to many regulatory restrictions placed on Taxis. That said it is a car hire service and does require the drivers to have licenses as well as the cars to be registered. These regulations are enforced in order to ensure passenger safety and curb traffic violations.
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: After each ride, the customer has an option to rate the ride overall out of 5 stars as well as rate the ride under specific categories such as driver courtesy, cleanliness of the vehicle, driver professionalism etc. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: As customers rate a particular driver, the driver gets a rating out of 5 stars which is just the average of all the customer ratings the driver has received. 
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 12,000,000 completed rides in 13 - 14
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $1,109,303,828
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: Logically Uber's business model is highly scalable. As Uber works on a commission basis, scaling would dramatically increase revenue. That said, because it's still a niche service only requested by select customers, it can be that scaling a 100 times would disrupt the supply - demand equilibrium that Uber has managed to achieve in the market today. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: Uber's advertising is mainly through word of mouth and online advertisement. A popular campaign gave users their first ride free of charge upto a $40 limit. The second campaign gave every user $20 of Uber credit in case someone they referred to Uber signed up and took a ride. They even gave the referred person a $20 Uber credit voucher. <p>The contributors are the Drivers who sign up to drive for Uber, pass the quality control and requirements checks and then begin servicing Uber customers. Uber sends the drivers a notification when a customer requests a vehicle which matches theirs and they then go provide the customer with transport services. <p>For the customer, it provides easy simple door to door service. Their credit cards are directly charged eliminating the whole paying after a ride business. Uber can be called anytime via the app and come pick you up for free. Additionally the cars are all luxury vehicles and the drivers are professionals. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Uber has been in the spotlight for 2 relatively well known incidents. Due to the regulatory gray area that Uber operates in, a lot of talk is happening with regards to the necessity to further regulate Uber in the marketplace.<p>Secondly, despite charging more than taxi's, Uber's business model doesn't quite add up. The numbers suggest that the drivers working for Uber actually make less than they would were they to operate a Taxi alone. <p>Lastly, in India, Uber has been requested to revamp their payment system as Indian Reserve Bank requires Uber to have 2 step payment authentication for all payments made by customers. Additionally, the government has requested Uber to accept payments in Indian Rupees as firms operating and providing services in India must accept Rupee payments. 
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: For every ride, Uber charges commission for providing the ridesharing / matching services. Uber takes a 20% cut from the final fare paid by the passenger.

  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Duolingo is a free language education and text translation platform.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: https://www.duolingo.com/
  when_was_the_company_started: November 2011
  who_were_the_founders: Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Duolingo was originally started as an academic project at Carnegie Mellon between Luis von Ahn and his PhD student Severin Hacker. Luis von Ahn was born and raised in Guatemala and saw firsthand how expensive it was to learn English, so after selling his second company reCAPTCHA to Google in 2009 Von Ahn decided to shift his focus towards language education. Von Ahn and Hacker had weekly half-hour meetings between 2009 and 2011 discussing ways to improve language education, resulting in the creation of Duolingo.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: Duolingo provides a free learning platform for individuals to learn a new language. At the end of lessons, the app allows users to practice by translating real articles. By combining many translations from high-level users, Duolingo can create an accurate translation of an article. As a result, Duolingo also acts as translation service for companies such as BuzzFeed and CNN. In addition, Duolingo has a language certification service. To add new languages "incubators" are created so that bilingual individuals can come together and help build curriculums.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: Duolingo updates both the language learning business model and the text-translation business model. Duolingo is able to provide a free language learning service for people, as opposed to other fee-based learning platforms. It also makes the learning process into a game by creating short exercises and awarding badges and points. At the same time, it is able to generate revenue by using the more traditional approach of charging companies for article translations.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Babbel<p>Lingualia<p>Livemocha (recently acquired by Rosetta Stone)<p>Busuu<p>italki
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: Duolingo's services can be accessed both through their website and their downloadable app. It is free and available to anyone who creates a profile. The sign up process takes about 30 seconds and only requires an email. After signing up, a user just clicks on a language he/she wants to learn and can begin doing exercises. The current courses available for english speakers are primarily romance languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, etc. For non-english speakers the languages available are very limited. As users get better with a language, they can click on "immersion" and translate real articles for practice.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: People who are learning a language on Duolingo also contribute text-translations for articles that are sold to companies such as BuzzFeed and CNN. The curriculums themselves are also crowdsourced by bilingual communities that are moderated by Duolingo.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Users are motivated to contribute and translate articles because it will help them learn a new language.
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: No
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: Duolingo assures the quality of the translations by aggregating many translations of top performing users. In addition, peers can "upvote" translations and proofread translations. To ensure curriculum quality, adding new languages is a thorough process. There are three phases for the language "incubator"&#58; private, beta, public. To contribute, users must apply and show they are fluent in both languages. There are also moderators that compile and edit work. The company continually does A/B testing on curriculums to improve the effectiveness of exercises.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: No
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: As exercises are completed in the curriculum, users are given points and badges which quantifies how well they know the language. In addition, user translations are checked by peers and are assigned "upvotes" or "downvotes" based on the quality. As you translate more articles you move up "translation tiers".
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Duolingo takes the translations of many users and combines them to create an accurate translation. Translations are also checked by peers to ensure they are accurate. When creating curriculums the company uses many contributors to create the content and then uses moderators to compile and edit work. A patented algorithm is used to ensure quality of the curriculums.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: 38 Million Users
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: Duolingo does not provide revenue numbers; however, profit is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: The business model is relatively scalable for wide spoken languages such as Spanish and French. As more companies join, there should be enough users to fill demand. As more users join, the learning process would not be affected so incentives will remain unchanged and quality will remain unaffected. However, scalability will most probably be limited for languages that are not in high demand due to the fact that not enough bilingual individuals will exist to generate the curriculum and not enough users will be able to translate the articles.
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: A language curriculum is created by a group of bilingual users (most major languages already have a curriculum). An individual signs up for Duolingo and chooses one of these languages. The individual completes game-like exercises and gains experience points. As the individual gains proficiency he/she will choose articles to translate to practice skills. These articles have been posted to the website by organizations who will pay Duolingo for the translation service. Many individuals translate the same article. These translations are aggregated and given to the organization. In the end, the individual learns a language, the company gets an article translated, and Duolingo makes a small profit.
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: No
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: Duolingo has had no major controversies
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Organizations can upload documents onto Duolingo to be translated for a fee. The company has contracts with BuzzFeed and CNN to translate articles for their international websites. In addition, Duolingo also has a language testing service similar to the TOEFL iBT that it charges $20 for.

  did_you_use_any_other_resources: 
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_the_company.: Silk Road is an anonymous marketplace, operated as a Tor service, that allowed users to buy and sell narcotics and other goods.
  give_a_url_for_the_companys_website: http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/ (This is the newest link I could find.  The Tor Browser is required to open it)
  when_was_the_company_started: February 2011
  who_were_the_founders: Dread Pirate Roberts is the pseudonym of the founder and operator of Silk Road. Ross William Ulbricht is currently accused of being DPR.
  does_it_have_an_interesting_origin_story: Silk Road was founded by Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, as what he or she calls a practical libertarian system. It was founded and designed to run on libertarian principles of no centralized power (like the government) and free markets. <p>Designed so that the state couldn't touch it for a very long time, Silk Road was built by DPR, not just for monetary reasons, but primarily to make a difference in the world markets. He or she believes that in such a free market environment, the existence of drug cartels and violence is minimized to almost zero, and the competitive nature of Silk Road also enforces quality products from vendors.
  what_service_does_the_company_provide: The company is an online marketplace. It works like any other marketplace like Amazon or eBay, in that it allows users to act like vendors or customers. <p>Vendors essentially stock the shelves at Silk Road, and put up goods for sale (typically shipped to any part of the world, from any part of the world) and customers place orders, and review the service and quality of goods provided by the various vendors. <p>Silk Road differs from Amazon and eBay, though, for 2 major reasons&#58;<p>1. Silk Road is completely anonymous. It used a Tor system which encrypts the location and meta-data of anyone accessing and hosting the website, making it really difficult for authorities to track down users. It also conducts all transactions in BitCoin, an online currency, which is unregulated in the global markets.<p>2. Apart from your regular goods like books, apparel, and merchandise (which comprise only a small fraction of transactions on Silk Road), the main bulk of transactions are narcotics from marijuana to LSD and heroin.
  does_this_update_a_previous_service_or_business_model,_or_is_it_completely_new: Updates a previous model
  if_it_updates_something,_what_does_it_replace: It's Amazon-if Amazon sold mind-altering chemicals- Adrien Chen, Editor, gawker.com.<p>Silk Road builds off typical e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay (it certainly doesn't replace them, though). As stated before it enhances privacy by running on the Tor system and allowing trades only by BitCoin, and is used primarily for buying and selling narcotic substances.
  what_other_new_companies_provide_services_that_are_similar_to_your_companys_: Black Market Reloaded<p>Atlantis<p>Sheep Marketplace
  what_is_an_example_of_how_someone_uses_this_service: There is actually a blogspot post on using Silk Road titled "Silk Road for Dummies" (Linked in the reference section).<p>A typical user would download the Tor Browser, so that their IP and other meta-data is private, and would find the newest link to the Silk Road website. <p>They could then browse through the various goods on offer and purchase them via BitCoin. They have an escrow system by which you first need to make a deposit to Silk Road. Silk Road then transfers the money internally to the sellers account. The seller can withdraw this money in BTC at any time and even hedge the trade to the USD price of BTC at the time of the sale. DPR would pay any difference accounting from the volatility of BTC. <p>Finally, you are shipped your goods by regular mail and can go back to Silk Road and rate the seller for the experience, quality, reliability, etc.
  compare_the_number_of_users_to_contributors.: More users than contributors
  who_are_the_people_who_contribute_services: Anyone who wants to sell a gram of marijuana or a book to people who want to sell large quantities of heroin contribute their listings to Silk Road. The primary vendors are people who have a large number of listings of various quantities, some even offering sample packs for free. <p>Contributors tend to use the same pseudonym to gain a reputation and good reviews. This helps them sell more and contributors who try to scam the system are blocked out by low reviews. This exemplifies the free market environment that DPR founded the website for.
  how_does_the_company_incentivize_them_to_contribute,_or_what_motivates_them_to_participate_: Anyone looking to sell illicit goods is incentivized to sell on Silk Road because of the following reasons&#58;<p>1. It is a free market and anyone can make their mark.<p>2. Formation of cartels is impossible and violence due to drug turf wars and drug deals are almost eliminated. <p>3. The privacy system was very well designed and the website ran without the authorities being able to bust it for almost 2 and a half years.<p>4. Silk Road provides a platform to sell goods from anywhere on the world to anywhere else (though most users were based in the US and the UK).
  is_this_a_service_that_was_previously_provided_by_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  are_the_contributors_experts_/_professionals: Yes
  how_does_the_company_ensure_the_quality_of_the_services_it_provides: The company tries to provide a free marketplace by really empowering the consumers through reviews. Consumers rate vendors and vendors with low ratings naturally die out. Further, Silk Road has certain rules that it enforces in terms of what can and cannot be sold on their website. Silk Road does not allow its vendors to sell child pornography, weapons, stolen credit cards, and contracts for murder. The company considers these against their morals because they consider it to cause harm to other innocents.
  is_its_service_something_that_is_typically_regulated_by_the_government: Yes
  if_so,_what_are_the_intents_of_the_regulations_and_does_your_company_meet_those_standards: Government regulations prohibit or control sale of many of the goods and substances that are sold on Silk Road. The intent of these regulations is to prohibit unhealthy usage of and addiction to these drugs.<p>Silk Road was made to provide the world with an alternate and unregulated marketplace based off the concepts of libertarianism. 
  is_a_reputation_system_used_by_your_company: Yes
  if_so,_how_does_it_work: The reputation system works just like the review system of Amazon does. Customers purchase goods from vendors and rate them out of 5 stars. <p>Most vendors who scam and provide low quality service are naturally left out of the environment. Most vendors, however, have high rating which signals a very competitive environment, with high customer satisfaction. 
  if_the_service_is_provided_by_many_contributors,_how_are_are_their_contributions_aggregated_: Various products by many contributors are listed and sorted in terms of department. Search features allow users to browse through all the listings, listings by department, or listings by a particular contributor.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_users: About 146,946 buyers and 3,877 seller accounts.
  what_is_the_scale_of_the_services_that_your_company_provides,_in_terms_of_dollars: $1.2 Million worth of transactions every month.
  if_your_company_were_to_scale_up_to_10_or_100_times_its_current_size,_how_well_do_you_think_its_business_model_would_work: An online market or e-commerce platform on a 10 to 100 times scale exists and scaling could definitely be possible in terms of the aggregation model, reviews, quality, incentive scheme, and business model. <p>What would be difficult to predict is whether there would be a compromise in terms of privacy because it might be difficult for the Tor system to scale up so much. 
  describe_the_workflow_for_how_the_service_is_advertised,_and_how_the_contributors_contribute,_and_what_the_users_get_in_the_end.: The service is very low key and not highly advertised. It's more of a word of mouth system that gets people on the site, as well as some blogs with the correct and updated url of the site. <p>Contributors choose to list products. Users can choose to buy these products, and the users get their product shipped to them. They can then review the vendor and his or her services. 
  is_there_anything_else_youd_like_to_say_about_the_company: 
  have_there_been_any_controversies_about_the_company_or_the_service_that_it_provides: The company itself is super controversial. <p>The DEA and the FBI have been trying to shut down Silk Road since it was formed and they finally managed to shut it down in October, 2013 and arrested Ross William Ulbricht under suspicion of him being "Dread Pirate Roberts", the founder of Silk Road. <p>Very soon after this, though, DPR was back with Silk Road 2.0 and a full plan on how to go about maintaining and securing the website. <p>In February of 2014, Silk Road was said to have been hacked and most of the BTC in its escrow system was said to have vanished.
  what_kind_of_organization_is_it: Privately held company
  how_does_the_company_generate_revenue: Silk Road charges a premium of every transaction that occurs on its website. Trade volumes on the website at its peak were about 1.2 million USD a month and revenue was close to $92,000 per month.
