<h1>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation</h1>

<h2>Assignments and grading</h2>

<p>Grades for the course will be based on weekly homework assignments and a final term project. The weekly homework will consist of a mixture of writing and programming assignments. You are allowed to work in groups of two for the weekly assignments, and turn in one submission for which both team members will receive the same grade.</p>

<p>You will be allowed 5 late days total to be used across all assignments, without penalty. Once you have used up your late days, you will lose 1 point for each day after the due date. </p>

<p>Please email your assignments to <b>crowdsourcing.class@gmail.com</b>, with <b>{{YOUR NAME}} Assignment #</b> in the subject line. (I tried for crowdsourcing-class@gmail.com, but '-' is a special character. I know. I cried, too.)</p>

<h3>Grading scale</h3>

<ul>
<li>9 weekly assignments : 45 pts (5 pt each)</li>
<li>In-class presentation of company profile : 10 pts </li>

Sample python code will be provided for many of the programming assignments.</p>

<ul>

<li>Due TBA Programming Assignment 5 : Train a machine learning classifier to predict sentiment on Twitter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final project</h2>

<p>The final term project will be a self-designed project created by the students in consultation with the professor and the TA.  Here are the guidelines for the final project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should solve a real world problem</li>
<li>Should actually use crowdsourcing (default: via MTurk)</li>
<li>Should involve either an HCI or a ML component</li>
<li>Should explain the choice of incentives and discuss alternative ways of incentivizing workers </li>
<li>Should contain a quality control component</li>
<li>Analyze costs, decide whether it is a viable business</li>
</ul>
