# Crowdsourcing and Human Computation

## Assignments and grading
Grades for the course will be based on weekly homework assignments and a final term project. The weekly homework will consist of a mixture of writing and programming assignments.  

## Written assignments

- [Written Assignment 1](assignments/wa1.html) : Sign up for a Worker accout on MTurk and write about your experience
- Written Assignment 2 : Write a synthesis of academic papers
- Written Assignment 3 : Write a company profile
- Written Assignment 4 : Cost analysis of Twitter sentiment classifer

## Programming assignments

You will complete a sequence of programming assignments that culminate in building a [Sentiment Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) system that will classify Tweets about companies as either positive, negative, or neutral.  Sample python code will be provided for many of the programming assignments.

- [Programming Assignment 1](assignments/pa1.html) : Sign up for a Requester account on MTurk, gather data from Twitter
- [Programming Assignment 2](assignments/pa2.html) : Design a HIT
- Programming Assignment 3 : Automaticaly grade the Turkers
- Programming Assignment 4 : Quality control comparison
- Programming Assignment 5 : Train a machine learning classifier to predict sentiment on Twitter

## Final project
The final term project will be a self-designed project created by the students in consultation with the professor and the TA.  Here are the guidelines for the final project.

- Should solve a real world problem
- Should actually use crowdsourcing (default: via MTurk)
- Should involve either an HCI or a ML component
- Should explain the choice of incentives and discuss alternative ways of incentivizing workers 
- Should contain a quality control component
- Analyze costs, decide whether it is a viable business

###Deliverables: 
- Midterm : Proposal for project, selection of team, pitch to class, critique 
- Progress Update : 2/3s of the way through: individual team meetings with TA+Prof, give concrete progress update
- Final : Writeup and demonstration system
