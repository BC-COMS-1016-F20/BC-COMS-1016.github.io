Lit Review<span class="text-muted">: Assignment 7</span> 
=============================================================
Paraphrasing and summarization are two very interesting, very open problems in NLP, which are very near and dear to my heart. The most popular way to automatically summarize is to just find the "best" sentences from the document(s) you want to summarize, and throw away the rest. The [other option](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/czhai/pub/coling10-opinosis.pdf) is to use lots of math and graphs to try to have the computer generate new text to summarize the document(s). The results of this approach are often...crap : 

- <b>Human</b> : The gas mileage on the camry was not good as it was advertised to be. Averaging around 25mpg on the highway does not make it a standout among other makes and models on the road.
- <b>Computer</b> : Gas mileage has been disappointing. Gas mileage is horrible and not good.

...Point being, reading and summarizing is something that we humans still win at. This should make you feel good and excited about showing off your kickass summarizing skills. So, this week, we want you to read three to five of the [academic papers mentioned in lectures](../resources.html), and provide a 4 page (+/- a few pages) synthesis of the ideas, experiments, and conclusions presented in those papers. The papers should all be related to the same general topic, and should be a topic we have discussed in class. Of course, you are welcome to choose papers not on the list, just run it by Chris and myself beforehand. 

(The point of the tangent above? If you can write a program to generate this synthesis automatically, so that I can not distinguish it from your own writing : A in the class, fame, fortune, prestige, and all the finest craft beer you can drink.)
