# Crowdsourcing and Human Computation

## Assignments and grading
Grades for the course will be based on weekly homework assignments and a final term project. The weekly homework will consist of a mixture of writing and programming assignments. You are allowed to work in groups of two for the weekly assignments, and turn in one submission for which both team members will receive the same grade.

You will be allowed 5 late days total to be used across all assignments, without penalty. Once you have used up your late days, you will lose 1 point for each day after the due date. 

Please email your assignments to <b>crowdsourcing.class@gmail.com</b>, with <b>{{YOUR NAME}} Assignment #</b> in the subject line. (I tried for crowdsourcing-class@gmail.com, but '-' is a special character. I know. I cried, too.)

###Grading scale

- 9 weekly assignments : 45 pts (5 pt each)
- In-class presentation of company profile : 10 pts 
- In-class proposal of final project : 10 pts
- In-class video demo of final project : 10 pts
- Final project : 25 pts

## Written assignments

- Due September 4 [Written Assignment 1](assignments/wa1.html): Sign up for a Worker accout on MTurk and write about your experience
- [<b>Sign up for a company and presentation date</b>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqm_QKjV_1EkdHdYRU1lOXFncHFxaXVDdTJqZVRuR1E&usp=sharing) Written Assignment 2 : Write a company profile 
- Written Assignment 3 : Write a synthesis of academic papers
- Written Assignment 4 : Cost analysis of Twitter sentiment classifer

## Programming assignments

You will complete a sequence of programming assignments that culminate in building a [Sentiment Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) system that will classify Tweets about companies as either positive, negative, or neutral.  Sample python code will be provided for many of the programming assignments.

- Due September 11 [Programming Assignment 1](assignments/pa1.html): Sign up for a Requester account on MTurk, gather data from Twitter
- Due Sepetember 18th [Programming Assignment 2](assignments/pa2.html): Design a HIT
- Due TBA [Programming Assignment 3](assignments/pa3.html) : Automaticaly grade the Turkers
- Due TBA [Programming Assignment 4](assignments/pa4.html) : Quality control comparison
- Due TBA Programming Assignment 5 : Train a machine learning classifier to predict sentiment on Twitter

## Final project
The final term project will be a self-designed project created by the students in consultation with the professor and the TA.  Here are the guidelines for the final project.

- Should solve a real world problem
- Should actually use crowdsourcing (default: via MTurk)
- Should involve either an HCI or a ML component
- Should explain the choice of incentives and discuss alternative ways of incentivizing workers 
- Should contain a quality control component
- Analyze costs, decide whether it is a viable business

###Deliverables: 
- Midterm : Proposal for project, selection of team, pitch to class, critique 
- Progress Update : 2/3s of the way through: individual team meetings with TA+Prof, give concrete progress update
- Final : Writeup and demonstration system
