Company Profile
=============================================================
As part of your [market research assignment](wa2.md), you will give a short 5 to 10 minute presentation on your company.  Your presentation should answer the following questions:

- What incentives does the company offer to get people to participate?
- How does it aggregate the information provided by the crowd?
- What are the quality concerns, and how does the company do quality control?
- How does the company benefit from user contributions?

Turn in a short writeup (~ 1 page) answering these questions by <b>Wednesday, September 25</b>. Your presentation slides are due on the day you give your presentation.

Your TA will give an example presentation for Intrade.  [Here are her slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IJJ0MfVyxHLJDAh2eVFHCL3ba1IRtsR5rpQf8M6VkTg/edit#slide=id.ge736661f_022)
