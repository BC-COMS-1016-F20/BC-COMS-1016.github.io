  name_of_your_project: Füd-Füd
  give_a_one_sentence_description_of_your_project: Our website will crowdsource food delivery.
  what_problem_does_it_solve: It solves the problem of a demand for food delivery from restaurants that do not offer a delivery option.
  what_similar_projects_exist: Instacart is the closest thing.  They are still different, however.  Instacart hires employees and handles delivery of groceries, alcohol, and other bulk purchase items, but crucially not already made food.
  what_type_of_project_is_it: A business idea that uses crowdsourcing
  who_will_be_the_members_of_your_crowd: It will likely be college students look for food, money, or both.
  how_will_you_incentivize_them_to_participate: Those who deliver food will get the bonus of working whenever they want to, delivering joy to those in their community, and of course the delivery fee.  Those who order food will get their food delivered to their door, at the time they want it, and for an agreed upon delivery fee.
  what_will_they_provide_and_what_sort_of_skills_do_they_need: Some will provide the delivery service, needing only the skill of buying food and walking to an address.  Others will provide the demand for food, and they need nothing but an appetite and laziness.
  how_will_you_ensure_the_quality_of_the_crowd_provides: Quality will be ensured by ratings that delivery users will rate customers on a few metrics, and customers will rate aspects of the delivery process.
  how_will_you_aggregate_the_results_from_the_crowd: Results from the crowd will be used to filter feeds for both the delivery user, and customers so that poorly rated users won't be matched again.
  describe_each_of_the_steps_involved_in_your_process_what_parts_will_be_done_by_the_crowd_and_what_parts_will_be_done_automatically: To begin with, users can either post requests for food deliveries, or post opportunities for others to get food delivered.  If there is a match between users looking for food, and users going to get food soon, then they will be automatically asked to settle on a delivery fee.  Once this is set, delivery users will go buy the food and deliver it to the customer who will pay the delivery person on venmo.  Then, the customers will be asked to rate the delivery person on quality, speed, price, and kindness.  The delivery user will then be asked to rank the customer on clarity of request, fairness of the pay, and kindness.
  how_will_you_evaluate_if_your_project_is_successful: Our project is successful if users from both sides of the service can sign up, log in, post requests and opportunities, fulfill requests, deliver, accept delivery fees, and rate their experience.  This will determine a successful project, but a successful business would need to create a platform with steady demand and supply.
  what_potential_problems_do_you_foresee_when_implementing_your_project: Not finding enough users to build demand or supply.  Having difficulty implementing all of the above features in time for the project's completion.  Communicating the benefits to both types of users.  Figuring out the payment flow might also prove difficult.  Ensuring quality will also be hard to do.
