Final Project<span class="text-muted"> : Part 1</span> 
=============================================================

This week's assignment counts as a deliverable toward your final project.  This assignment will be worth 10% of your final grade.  

###Step 1: Form a team

Your final project must be done in a group.  The size of the group can be 2-4 people.  Find some awesome people.  Do you remember what James Surowiecki says about groups?  They're best if they are composed of a diverse set of people.  So maybe you should try to pick out people who aren't already your friends.  Use the [Piazza message board](https://piazza.com/class/hzdefdi7bbl3xg?cid=5) to advertise that you're looking for teammates. 

###Step 2: Form a team


This assignment is due before class on <b>Wednesday, October 8th</b>.  You must work in groups on this project.  You must declare who is in your group when you turn your assignment.
