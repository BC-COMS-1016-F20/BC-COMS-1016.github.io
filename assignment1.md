Become a Crowd Worker <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 1</span> 
=============================================================

The point of the first assignment is to get to acquainted with Mechanical Turk from the worker's perspective. The crowdsourcing platform allows us, the programmers, to work with humans as though they are function calls (fulfilling every antisocial CS student's dreams). Since, for the rest of the semester, you will be relying on Turkers to complete work for you quickly and accurately, you should take this first assignment as an opportunity to understand your workers and the ways you can help them work best for you. Pay attention to what makes tasks interesting and attractive, how much each task pays, and whether you think the compensation is fair. We will ask you to turn in a short writeup describing your experience.

You should be excited about this assignment! You will actually get *paid* to do it! For my 50 HITs, I made a full $1.14. That is a far better return than the [terrible stock](https://www.google.com/finance?q=vaso&ei=oBMMUqixB47q0QH-owE) which I am holding for no good reason. So go! Have fun!

In this assignment you’ll choose at least 50 assignments to complete.  We’re going to do an experiment to compare how much money you make under two conditions.  The first condition is using the MTurk interface, and the second condition is using a productivity tool that your instructor has built, called [Crowd Workers](http://crowd-workers.com/landing). 

1. Sign up for MTurk as a worker [here](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome).  Please do this as early as possible, since it can take 48 hours or more to have your account approved. <a href = "#special_note"> *If you were not able to create an account, follow these instructions.* </a>
2. Sign up for MTurk as a requester [here](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). You won't use this for this assignment directly, but we want everyone signed up early so we can get you set up with Amazon credits.
3. Install the [Crowd Workers](http://crowd-workers.com/landing) Google Chrome extension. This will track and help you to analyze the work that you’ve done. Please use the Google Chrome web browser with the Crowd Workers plugin installed for all of this homework assignment.
4. Next, choose at least 50 assignments to complete.  You should pick a goal for yourself.  You can try to make as much money as you can, or you try to make the highest hourly rate that you can.
5. For the first 25 HITs that you do, use the [search tools provided by Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/findhits?match=false).
 Try to get a sense of the variety of tasks that are available, and the kinds of projects for which Mturk is being used. Once you sign up, you will see that you *can* complete this assignment by transcribing 50 receipts, but is it really worth it? 
6. For your second 25 HITs, use the search tools provided on the [Crowd Workers web service](http://crowd-workers.com/discover). 
7. There are several tools for better Turking. Please explore a few of these and give us your thoughts.
* [Turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) 
* [TurkerNation](http://turkernation.com/)
* [mTurk List](http://mturklist.com) 
* [HITs worth Turking for](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/new/?sort=new) 
8. After you have finished working, please answer the following questions about your experience and turn in your answers using [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16qS3R6Tc9T807NxHCf_fbS8znBOAjJQVG6NFhyCM_oQ/viewform?usp=send_form).

**Extra Credit** The Crowd Workers extension you tried is mostly likely the next big thing in crowdsourcing. Right now, it is still a startup in its humble beginnings, being run out of the coffee-cup strewn office of a mere tenure-track professor at an Ivy League university. Help it gain some credibility by leaving a review in the [Google Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crowdworkers/aamdbafophajiecmhbnbakndfgjkfpce/reviews) (we can debate [ethics](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/technology/give-yourself-4-stars-online-it-might-cost-you.html?_r=0) later). You will get extra credit if you leave any review, it doesn't have to be a good one, and provide your critiques about how to improve the plugin on the survey.

<div id = "special_note">
<h4>Two options if you were not able to create a Mechanical Turk account:</h4>
<p>
1. Borrow a classmate's Mechanical Turk account<br>
2. Sign up to be a contributor for CrowdFlower <a href = "https://elite.crowdflower.com/?view=register"> here. </a>CrowdFlower, like Mechanical Turk, is a crowdsourcing platform where you can sign up as a contributor (to do tasks) or a customer (to create tasks).
</p>
<p>
We recommend the first option because there are more tasks and tools available for Mechanical Turk. However, you also have the option to make a CrowdFlower account in case you want to do more tasks in the future.
